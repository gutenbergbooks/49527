<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This bulletin is the third in a series of six, recounting the field
work done among Wisconsin Indians to discover their present uses of
native or introduced plants and, insofar as is possible, the history of
these plant uses by their ancestors. As far back as 1888 Hoffman<a name="FNanchor_85_1" id="FNanchor_85_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_1" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
reported that the medicinal lore of the Ojibwe would soon be gone.
But thirty-two years later, it is still partially recalled and practised
among the more primitive bands of these people. How long it will
persist is problematical. The Ojibwe are the most numerous of any
of our tribes and as long as they live in the northern forest and lake
district of Wisconsin, so long will the older Indians continue to explain
the natural history of their environment to the young men and
women of the tribe.</p>

<p>The writer deplores the brevity of the time that could be devoted
to each tribe, and applauds the similar study reported by Miss Frances
Densmore<a name="FNanchor_86_2" id="FNanchor_86_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_2" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in her fifteen years of research among the Ojibwe. Necessarily
the most valuable information comes from the oldest Indians,
and many informants have died since this study was made.</p>

<p>Three trips were made, usually of six weeks duration. The first
was made in June, 1923 to the Lac du Flambeau Reservation, in Vilas
County, Wisconsin. The same region was visited again later in the
fall. During the spring of 1924 one trip was made to Leech Lake,
Minnesota, where the remnant of the Pillager Band of the Ojibwe
live on Bear Island, (<a href="#plate60">Plate 60</a>, fig. 1), and the surrounding mainland.
Since then, trips have been made to Redcliff, Bayfield County, to
Odanah, Iron County, to Lac Court Oreilles, Clark County, and to
scattered bands in various sections of northern Wisconsin. The
principal work was done at Lac du Flambeau and Leech Lake. The
Leech Lake trip checked results obtained at Lac du Flambeau.</p>

<p>The writer thanks those officials and private citizens who assisted
by introductions to Indians and by making his stay among them
comfortable. Mr. James W. Balmer, Indian Agent, then at Lac du
Flambeau, now at Pipestone, Minnesota, and his chief clerk, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p334" id="p334">[334]</a></span>
Walter H. Shawnee, a Shawnee Indian, still in service at Lac du
Flambeau, and Mr. John Allen, Ojibwe Indian and school disciplinarian
all gave valued advice and quartered us at their Teacher’s
Club. Mr. Edward Rogers, of Walker, Minnesota, a very successful
Ojibwe attorney, and the Noble brothers, Mr. John W. Noble and
Mr. E. W. (“Van”) Noble, proprietor of Forest View Lodge, directly
across from Bear Island, rendered valuable assistance with the Pillager
band of Ojibwe.</p>

<p>The writer collected every plant he could find in each region because
he had been informed that the Ojibwe differ from other Wisconsin
Indians in that they believe that every plant that grows is some kind
of medicine or useful for something. The only plants discovered for
which they had no name or use were adventive plants, and one could
fairly well establish the date of their appearance in the state, because
the Indians pay much more attention to our native flora than do the
whites.</p>

<p>Most of our informants were men, because they found it easier
to talk to the writer than the women. It was easy to get the women
to talk of old time methods of preparing aboriginal foods. The Ojibwe
had a large number of hunting medicines used as charms. These
were accompanied by drawings on the ground designating what
they hoped to accomplish in killing game for their larder. About
sixty-five per cent of their medicinal plants were actually valuable
medicinally, the remainder being employed in a shamanistic or superstitious
manner. The writer concludes that their great knowledge of
plants has been achieved through long periods of time by a process
of trial and error, basing this belief upon their fear of mushrooms.
Both men and women pointed out plants in their native habitat and
were willing to explain their uses. They are the real ones to thank
for the facts discovered and without their cooperation such a study
would be impossible. A list of them follows.</p>

<p>In conformity with previous bulletins, the plants will be listed
(1) under their various uses and (2) under each of these captions,
alphabetically by their families. Where possible, the literal translation
of the Indian name is given.<a name="FNanchor_87_3" id="FNanchor_87_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_3" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<h2>PHONETIC KEY</h2>

<p>The Ojibwe have written their language for a longer time than
any other Algonquin tribe and, while they employ a syllabary<a name="FNanchor_88_4" id="FNanchor_88_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_4" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> in
corresponding with absent members of the tribe, it has little value
to the ethnologist. The writer has two books printed in English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p336" id="p336">[336]</a></span>
Ojibwe. One is “A collection of Chippeway and English Hymns”,
translated by Peter Jones, Indian Missionary, the second edition
of which was printed by the Methodist Book Concern in 1847.
This was given to the writer by Mr. Henry Ritchie, an Ojibwe, of
Laona, Wisconsin. The other is “A Dictionary of the Otchipwe

Bishop Baraga, published by Beauchemin and Valois, Montreal, in
1878. This was given to the writer by Capt. John Valentine
Satterlee, of the Menomini tribe, Keshena, Wisconsin. With the aid

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The subjects of this bulletin, the Ojibwe Indians, have probably
been designated by more different spellings of their name than any
other tribe in the country. The anglicized version is Chippewa, an
adaptation of the Ojibway of Longfellow. Ojibway means “to roast
till puckered up,” referring to the puckered seams on their moccasins,
from “Ojib”, “to pucker up”, “ub-way”, “to roast”. In historic
literature some of the more common ways of spelling their name have
been: Achipoes, Chepeways, Chipaways, Odjibwag, Otchipwe, Uchipweys.
Less familiar names applied to them have been: Baouichtigouin,
Bawichtigouek, Dewakanha, Dshipowehaga, Estiaghicks,
Hahatwawne, Khahkhahtons, Neayaog, Ninniwas, Saulteur, Santeaux,
Wahkahtowah and at least fifty others.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe is one of the largest tribes in the United States and
Canada, and lived originally along both shores of the Great Lakes
as far west as the Turtle Mountains, North Dakota. They are of
Algonkian stock and in the north are closely related to the Cree and
Maskegon tribes. In the south, through Michigan, Wisconsin and
Minnesota they have always been closely associated with the Ottawa
and Pottawatomi. These three have been recently called the Three
Fires Confederacy. Their languages were even similar, and Pottawatomi
have often told the writer that their tongue was an abbreviated
Ojibwe language,—“like it was a nickname”.</p>

<p>This numerous people lived far away from the frontiers of the
colonial war period, hence are not often mentioned in the early history
of the United States. The original habitation of the Ojibwe in Wisconsin
is supposed to have been at La Pointe, a town no longer in
existence, in Ashland County, near Lake Superior. The first reference
to them in history is in the Jesuit Relation of 1640 when they resided
at Sault Ste. Marie. It is thought that Nicolet met them either
in 1634 or 1639. Father Allouez found them at Superior, Wisconsin, in
1665-67. According to Perrot,<a name="FNanchor_89_5" id="FNanchor_89_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_5" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> in 1670-99 those Ojibwe on the Lake
Superior shore of Wisconsin cultivated corn and were living peaceably
with their neighbors, the Sioux. About this time they first obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="p338" id="p338">[338]</a></span>
fire-arms, and pushed their way westward fighting with the Sioux
and the Meskwaki. The French established a trading post at Shangawawmikong,
afterwards La Pointe, in 1692, which was the most
important Ojibwe settlement in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In the early years of the eighteenth century, the Ojibwe succeeded
in driving the Meskwaki from northern Wisconsin, when the Meskwaki
joined forces with the Sauk Indians. The Ojibwe then turned their
attention to the Sioux, driving them across the Mississippi and as
far as the Turtle Mountains in North Dakota. The Ojibwe took
part in frontier settlement wars up to the close of the war of 1812.
Those living within the United States made a treaty with the Government
in 1815 and have since remained peaceful, with the exception of a
minor uprising among the Pillager Band of Ojibwe on Leech Lake,
Minnesota. Most of them live on reservations or allotted land in
Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota. There was a
small band of Swan Creek and Black River Ojibwe who sold their
lands in Michigan in 1836 and went to live with the Munsee, in
Franklin County, Kansas.</p>

<p>It was represented to the writer that the Pillager Band of Ojibwe
should be quite interesting and primitive since they were the only
unsubdued Indians left in the United States. They are supposed to
have revolted during the Civil War, when Government attention was
concentrated on determining whether or not, the Union should be
preserved. They pillaged a small town, killed the inhabitants, took all
of the food stores and fled to Bear Island in Leech Lake, Minnesota,
shown in <a href="#plate60">plate 60</a>, fig. 1. Again, while the United States was at war
with Spain in 1898, the Ojibwe complained bitterly about certain
irregularities in regard to the disposal of the dead and fallen timber
on Leech Lake Reservation. They accused white speculators of
firing the woods to create a class of timber known as dead and down
timber, thus depriving them of their winter livelihood in logging
operations.<a name="FNanchor_90_6" id="FNanchor_90_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_6" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Rather indiscriminate arrests of the Pillager Indians by United
States marshals caused resentment and the actual warfare was caused
by the attempt of a deputy marshal to arrest certain Indians accused
of selling whiskey on the reservation. On September 15, 1898, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="p339" id="p339">[339]</a></span>
Indians were arrested by deputy marshals and rescued by their
comrades. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the more than
twenty Indians who had assisted in the rescue. Since the marshals
feared the Indians, they asked for the assistance of troops. It was
thought that a show of force by regular troops would be sufficient.
Twenty men of the Third Regiment U. S. Infantry were sent, but
since the Indians showed no sign of yielding eighty more left Fort
Snelling for Walker, Minnesota. Major M. C. Wilkinson and General
J. M. Bacon were in charge.</p>

<p>Two small lake steamers and a barge took the troops to Bear Island,
and they anchored in shoal water just across from the island, proceeding
by barge to the mainland. The battle took place at the house
of Bujonegicig, who died only a few years ago. The troops were fired
upon from the woods and Major Wilkinson, Sergeant Butler and four
privates were killed. Ten were wounded. On October 6, 1898, 214
more troops came to assist, but no further firing was encountered
and the uprising was over. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, W.
A. Jones, arrived from Washington, October 10. The next morning
he and Father Aloysius, a priest with great influence over the Indians,
held a long and friendly conference with the Pillager chiefs investigating
and settling the timber complaints. Troops flooded that
country and persuaded the Bear Islanders to respond to the warrants.
They were duly tried, sentenced and fined, but the fines were remitted
and after two months imprisonment the sentences were commuted
and pardons granted.</p>

<p>The writer found but few who remembered the battle, for while
there were over a hundred men able to bear arms in 1898, the Ojibwe
could not successfully fight the influenza attack of 1919 and the present
population consists of only fourteen persons: John Peper,
wife, daughter and mother; White Cloud, shown in <a href="#plate59">plate 59</a>, fig. 2,
wife and son; Moîckaˈwus and wife; John Smith, Frank Marshall,
wife and two children. John Peper’s mother was said to be 106 years
old and looked the part, as shown in <a href="#plate59">plate 59</a>, fig. 1. John, her youngest
boy was past 70 years of age. Another very old resident, John
Smith, had died the year before the writer arrived. His age was
said to be 138 years. His recollections are said to have included
George Washington as President of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p340" id="p340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>All of our Ojibwe residents in Wisconsin and those in Michigan
and Minnesota were forest Indians and, as such, great hunters,
although they cultivated maize in a small way. They made very
superior birch bark canoes and were at home on the many lakes of
the northland, subsisting largely on fish and game. While at
the present time, they dress themselves to satisfy the pre-conceived
ideas of tourists, in the early days, their headdress consisted
of otter skin caps, often embellished with eagle feathers, one for
each enemy slain in battle and consequently for each scalp secured.
The great feathered bonnet was not of their culture, but has been more
recently borrowed from the Plains Indians. They never used the
tepee of the Plains Indians, such as is shown in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>, fig. 2,
and in <a href="#plate58">plate 58</a>, fig. 2, but built a wigwam. The wigwam was easily
constructed in a half-day’s time. Poles were thrust into the ground
in a circle of from twelve to twenty feet, their tips bent and securely
tied in the center with basswood bark cord to form a hemisphere,
about eight feet in height at the center. The whole was then covered
with bark of balsam, or woven cat-tail mats, such as the one shown
in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>, fig. 2, and roofed with birch bark. An entrance and
smoke hole were left and mats thrown upon the ground. It was much
warmer than a tepee and better adapted to the heavy snow fall of
the north, and to low temperatures. All of their storage houses
and their smaller sweat lodges were similarly made. Their medicine
lodges followed the same construction though they were much longer:
being eighty, a hundred and even a hundred and fifty feet in length.</p>

<p>We had occasion to see the medicine lodge in use several times
during our stay at Lac du Flambeau. This lodge was in the old
Flambeau village, just at the edge of the woods. It was a huge affair,
about one hundred and fifty feet long, with a stout framework of
saplings joined together and arched over at a height of eight feet.
The framework was rigidly held together with other horizontal saplings
secured by basswood bark cord at every junction of poles. It stood
as a framework for several years. During use, the sides of this framework
are covered with cat-tail mats and the top with sewed birch
bark, as shown in figure 21, of the Museum’s 1923 Yearbook. By
using a bone needle and nettle string the cat-tail mats are sewed
together with an invisible stitch, that makes a windproof cover.</p>

<p>Down the center of the lodge is a long ellipse where countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="p341" id="p341">[341]</a></span>
dance steps have bared the earth of this otherwise grassy plot. The
entrance of the lodge faces the east, and there is an exit to the west.
A fire is usually burning just inside the eastern entrance, the smoke
ascending through a smoke hole left in the roof. The medicine men
are gathered to the left of the fire on the north while the patient is
usually seated to the right of the fire on the south. The medicine
drum in use during a treatment for healing is smaller than the dream
dance drum, usually seen by tourists, and of a different shape. It
is about eight inches in diameter and sixteen inches high. The buckskin
stretched over the end is moistened from time to time by reversing
the drum which contains water, and rubbing the skin to
permit it to take up the liquid. The tone and volume are greatly
enhanced by this procedure.</p>

<p>The medicine lodge members sit in groups around the lodge starting
at the north side, and proceeding down to the west and back
along the south side toward the east again. Every song and march
around the lodge is repeated four times, this being their sacred number.
The time needed in effecting a cure is varied but the writer has seen a
woman carried in on a litter, recover in three hours time and take
part in the dancing.</p>

<p>The Indian Service in the past has wished to discourage treatment
by medicine men and on larger reservations has supplied a resident
physician. It is a constant competition between the two, for naturally
a white physician cannot cure every case any more than a medicine
man can, and when the medicine man apparently effects cures after
the physician has given up or appeared to produce no improvement, the
credulous patients are going to continue to believe in the medicine
men. Christianity has had but little effect upon the Ojibwe so far
as the writer has been able to observe, largely because of the reputation
of the medicine men among them.</p>

<p>According to the late Dr. William Jones, the ethnologist mentioned
in “Ethnobotany of the Meskwaki Indians”, Part 2 of this volume,
the Pillager Band of Bear Island occasionally practiced cannibalism
ceremonially, and even as late as 1902 ate human flesh on the Rainy
River during a famine. He cites the fact in 1905 that polygamy was
once common and even still occurred among wandering bands.</p>

<p>Many visitors to the northland think of the country in terms of
sand, and consider it unfit for use agriculturally. While sandy soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="p342" id="p342">[342]</a></span>
is common, it is also easy to find very good productive soil and in some
cases even clay. The Indian settlements and homesteads were never
extensive and four or five acres of land seem to suffice them for
growing hay and garden crops. The agency Indian farmer maintains
demonstration garden plots, such as the one shown in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>, fig. 1,
and also more extensive farms, and constantly advises with those
who are trying to farm. The Indian women even grow some cultivated
flowers. At Lac du Flambeau, the Ojibwe take great pride
in their annual Indian fair and display farm animals, horticultural
products, and native arts and crafts for premiums. It is a pity that
more do not follow agriculture because they have sufficient farming
land and have also good examples to follow. Most of them like the
quick returns made in selling Indian art work, or made acting as
guides for fishing and hunting parties. The easy money is too soon
spent and they suffer considerably before the winter is over.</p>

<p>The native flora is about the same at both Lac du Flambeau and
Leech Lake, and the species are by no means as varied as on the
Menomonie Reservation. They make full use of everything that occurs
with them except the adventive or introduced plants. They recognize
regular types of soil as sources of their medicinal plants. Sandy
meadows, sandy wastes, lakes, still ponds, swamps, upland swamps,
rocky openings in the forest, evergreen forests, and hardwood forests
all are searched for distinctive plants. The greatest number of species
of native plants are found in the composite family and we find the Ojibwe
making more use of these than any other tribe. The heath
family contributes many species and is important to them. Grasses
and sedges, while numerous in species are not so well known to them,
although here again they use more species than the neighboring tribes.</p>

<p>John Whitefeather, of the Couderay Ojibwe, who adopted the
writer into their tribe, related their origin myth. Briefly it is as
follows: There has always been a controversy among the whites
as to whether such an Indian as Hiawatha ever lived. Hiawatha is
the name that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow gave to their cultural
hero, Winabojo. Hiawatha or Winabojo was never seen by man,
although sometimes both names have been used for proper names
among the Ojibwe. Their great spirit or ruler of the universe was
named Dzhe Manido.</p>

<p>According to Whitefeather, Winabojo was the one who caused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p343" id="p343">[343]</a></span>
deluge that covered the world and was responsible for building it
again. Winabojo was sitting at the mouth of a big river and noticed
a stick bobbing up and down near the middle of the stream. He
thought it was curious that it was not carried on down stream to the
big lake and further thought that it would be fun to sit on the stick.
So he swam out and sat on it. Dzhe Manido had told him two phrases,
one of which he might sing to himself, which is translated “Lake
must close in” and the other was “Lake should spread out”, and he
must not say that. Winabojo became curious to see what would
happen if he repeated the second of these phrases. He said it. Immediately
the stick sank and he fell under. He swam back to the top
but could discover no land. Other animals were swimming around,
so he requested muskrat to dive down and get him some mud from the
bottom of the lake. Muskrat dived down but it was too far and he
drowned. The martin tried it and drowned. The otter tried it
and drowned. Then beaver tried it and obtained some mud, but died
as he reached the surface. Winabojo took the mud that remained
between the claws of beaver and rolled it into a little ball. Winabojo
made this ball grow as he rolled it around in his hands, while the
animals swam around him. Finally the ball grew large enough for
the fox to jump upon it and run around. Then it grew larger until
all the animals could get upon it.</p>

<p>So Winabojo and the animals were the first inhabitants and Winabojo
put the plants upon the world. Winabojo lived in a little valley
with his grandmother, Nokomis. Against her wishes, he went on
a voyage of exploration, leaving his valley to climb a hill. In the
next valley he saw a lot of people all dancing and he wanted to dance
with them. So he went down and danced all day, though none of
them spoke to him or said a word to each other. When the wind died
down at sunset, he discovered them to be only cattails, so he started
back home. On his way he was approached by Cumpa. No one knows
who sent Cumpa there, but we think that it was Dzhe Manido. Nokomis
had told him that there were inhabitants somewhere on the
earth. Winabojo sat down with Cumpa and they talked over the
matter of how to regulate the world. In their conference they developed
the medicine lodge idea and the Ojibwe count Winabojo as its
founder. The painted post that they erect in their medicine lodge
represents Winabojo. It is carved to resemble a human form, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="p344" id="p344">[344]</a></span>
not too closely, as they wish it to be understood that Winabojo is a
god and not a human being.</p>

<p>Winabojo started during the month of July to hunt for the inhabitants
of the earth and finally found them in the latter part of
December or early January. Then he stayed with them for several
months, teaching them the secrets of the medicine lodge. He told them
how they must gather roots and what songs they must sing. A specimen
song and its meaning is here given.</p>

<p>Their story of creation is the common one among the northern
Algonkians. They believe that all objects, both animate and inanimate
possess some mysterious power, and speak of that power as
the manido that dwells in it. On the Lac du Flambeau Reservation,
the writer saw two or three large stones, shown in <a href="#plate48">plate 48</a>, fig. 2, that
were thought to be spirit rocks. They also believed that the spirit
of the departed brave often returns to the grave, as long as the body
has not turned to dust. They often buried the body in a sitting position
facing west, or in a shallow grave on its back or side, making a
mound, over which bark, birch poles or boards were erected, to form
a little grave house, as shown in <a href="#plate51">plate 51</a>, fig. 2. This, they believe
to be often inhabited by the spirit of the departed one which they
occasionally feed with wild rice or dried jerky (deer meat) through
a small opening. According to McKenney,<a name="FNanchor_91_7" id="FNanchor_91_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_7" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the Ojibwe of Fond
du Lac, Wisconsin, buried their dead in a box which was elevated
upon a platform of poles. Mourning for the departed usually lasted
a year, unless some medicine man shortened the time, or a relative
performed some notable feat in war.</p>

<p>Their religion was the teachings of their Grand Medicine society
or midewiwin. The Ojibwe are probably the strictest disciples of this
society of any of our Wisconsin Indians and the part played<span class="pagenum"><a name="p345" id="p345">[345]</a></span>
by plants is the greatest of any factor. Things other than
plants were used, such as rattlesnake meat, duck bones, clay and
feathers, but these were so far in the minority that they are scarcely
worth mentioning. According to the Ojibwe, every plant is medicine;
if not to your particular informant, then to some other medicine man
or woman. It was a matter of finding the proper informant to get the
correct name and use. Consequently, in the field we gathered every
tree, shrub, perennial or annual, herb or grass we encountered. All of
these being medicinal plants were thus sacred to them and must be
secured with the proper mide ceremony. This consisted of an
explanatory song, and the offering of tobacco to grandmother, the
earth, and Winabojo, their cultural hero.</p>

<p>The constant effort of the Government to educate the Indian is
resulting in the gradual discarding of the medicine lodge ceremonies.
The Ojibwe, who have stayed on the frontier of civilization, are
among the last to change, and have clung tenaciously to their medicine
society. As with other Wisconsin Indians, the Ojibwe love their
children dearly and are rarely harsh to them. The children are taught
to dance at an early age and while subsequent education may make
them forget the names and uses of medicinal plants, they never forget
the dance tunes and steps. It is a common conception among white
men that it is useless to educate an Indian. Too many have agreed
with Mark Twain that “the only good Indian is a dead one.” Stories
are related concerning Indian college graduates that revert to the
tepee and to the dog feast. Some of these may be true, but according
to Indian psychology, there is nothing disgraceful about this. It is
the fallacy of the white man in trying to impose his culture on other
peoples and in always assuming that it is superior to any other way of
living. We are prone to point to the exceptional fall from grace, and
forget about the many who have made a success of their life according
to our standards. There are many full-blooded Indian men and
women in Milwaukee, who are useful citizens. Many Milwaukee men
and women are proud of the Indian strain in their blood. Education
has been of great assistance to the Ojibwe, who have many times
proven that they have the same capabilities as their white brothers.
The Indian has the same anatomical characteristics as the Caucasian
race and is capable of going far along the road of education.</p>

<p>Since the field work among the Ojibwe was completed in 1923 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p346" id="p346">[346]</a></span>
1924, some scattering members of the tribe have adopted the peyote
lodge. The Ojibwe are fond of visiting and, in the summer time, some
are always away on visits to other tribes in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota,
the Dakotas, Kansas or Oklahoma. The old idea of fighting
other tribes was forgotten long ago and they feel that all red men are
their brothers. Those Ojibwe who have visited the Winnebago Indians
in Wisconsin have been especially influenced to adopt the peyote
cult. This rarely happens where the Ojibwe live in close contact with
their tribesmen on reservations. But several live as isolated families
on the shores of our northern lakes, and when they adopt the peyote
religion they throw overboard all of their medicine lodge paraphernalia
and beliefs.</p>

<p>The members of the peyote cult, chew and swallow the peyote
buttons which are the button-shaped branches of a cactus (<i>Lophophora
williamsii</i>) found in Texas, New Mexico and Old Mexico. The
practice is said to have originated among the Indians of old Mexico.
Under its narcotic influence the peyote Indian claims to see in a vision
and to commune with Jesus Christ, who gives him the rule of conduct
for his life. The Indians justify their use of peyote by comparing
it to the sacramental wine of the white man. However, peyote carries
a governmental disapproval and the Indian police are supposed
to be vigilantly alert for peyote. A jail sentence, as well as confiscation
of the supply of peyote, is meted out to any member they can
detect using it.</p>

<p>Another type of ceremonial dance used by the Ojibwe, and in fact
by all of the forest Indians of Wisconsin, is the dream dance, such as is
shown in <a href="#plate47">plate 47</a>, fig. 1. While this is sacred, it is not performed in secret,
and the white people are often invited to come and witness these
dances. They do come from many miles away to see the Indian dances
and games. At the Lac du Flambeau Reservation, they perform
several kinds of dances, such as the corn dance, the warrior dance, the
prisoner dance, the deer hunt dance, and many others.</p>

<p>One dance in particular was brought back from Oklahoma by
Anawabi. It is called the “Squaw Dance.” In it men and women
dance together, as shown in figure 20 of the Museum’s Yearbook for
1923. Anawabi, the medicine man, was credited with powers of
witchcraft as well as healing. A young Ojibwe boy sick with pneumonia,
told his parents in a delirium that Anawabi had come and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="p347" id="p347">[347]</a></span>
taking his breath away. His parents believed him, and he eventually
died, but before he did, some friend hastened to Anawabi and Anawabi
stood not on the order of his going, but left at once for Oklahoma
where he stayed two years. He probably witnessed the modern two
step among the Oklahoma Indians, which they called the “Squaw
Dance.” It is distinctly opposed to the Indian way of dancing. It
has always been the custom for women to remain in the background
at any of the old time dances, dancing by themselves, outside and
back of the circle or group of the men. For them to take an equal part
in a dance seems out of place. This caused a rift in the tribe, and the
older residents at the old Flambeau village will have nothing to do with
such dances.</p>

<p>The participants in the dream dance usually dress in all of their
native finery and nowadays wear many ornaments that are not of
Ojibwe origin. While under the spell of the singing and drumming,
the dancers assume a smiling face and are usually oblivious to the
presence of any spectators.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe use two types of drums. One is the large dream-dance
drum, about two feet in diameter and fourteen inches deep.
The other is a tambourine-shaped drum of rawhide only a couple of
inches thick and possibly ten inches in diameter, suspended by a loop
of sinew, decorated with human figures, and beaten with the hands
or a smaller bone drum stick. This drum is used in games and the
songs differ considerably for the various games. La Crosse, the
woman’s shinny game, the bowl and dice game, the moccasin game
and others are all announced by preliminary songs from the chief,
who accompanies himself on the game drum.</p>

<p>In writing this bulletin, the system adopted in previous bulletins
will be followed. Plants not found to be of use are included in this
list, as other investigators may find that they were used. The listing
of each plant will be by family and English names, followed by the
Latin binomial according to Gray’s Manual of Botany, then the
Ojibwe name and its literal translation, if that be known. Following
this will be the uses, methods of use, supposed properties, its value
as an official or eclectic drug by the whites, and any known myth connected
with it. The same procedure will be followed in the other subheadings
under investigation, viz.: foods, fibers, dyes, and plants of miscellaneous
uses such as utility, good luck charms, love potions and so on.</p>

<h2><a name="MEDICINES" id="MEDICINES"></a>OJIBWE MEDICINES</h2>

<p>The Ojibwe are probably the best informed and the strictest
observers of the medicine lodge ceremonies in the country. Their
knowledge of plants both in their own environment and far away is
probably the best of any group of Indians. While their flora is not
so rich in species as that of Indians farther south, they make trips
far away from their home to obtain necessary plants.</p>

<p>As among the white people, one plant may bear several common
names, according to different individuals in different sections of the
country, and again, one name may be given to several plants, as in
the case of plants used as “revivers”. Yet, there is an agreement in
names of Lac du Flambeau and Leech Lake Ojibwe, that well checks
information received. The name is usually descriptive, just as their
names for animals usually are either descriptive or representative of
the cry or note uttered by the animal, like “ko-ko-ko-o”, the hoot
owl, or “ka-ka-ka”, the raven or crow. The medicine name usually
tells what the plant looks like, where it may be found, some peculiar
taste or property, or its chief use. Often a termination is added
signifying the plural of a noun or the part of the plant used, such as
the wood, the leaf, the flower, the root, or the berry or fruit.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that they understand the proper time to gather
the plant part. At times, the medicinal qualities are inert, undeveloped
or dispersed by being too old. Much of the knowledge of white
men originated from studying the Indian plant uses, in the early
days. Eclectic practitioners sought the Indian herbs and observed
carefully what parts of the plant were used. This mass of early information
was sifted scientifically by the students of medicine, and
finally tested physiologically on animals. Perhaps sixty-five per cent
of their remedies were found to be potent and are included in our
pharmacopoeas; the other thirty-five per cent were discovered to be
valueless medicinally. All of the references to uses of the plants by
white men were obtained from the 1916 edition of the National
Standard Dispensatory, by Hare, Caspari &amp; Rusby.</p>

<p>The medicine man depended largely upon his reputation and often
cured fancied diseases by shamanistic suggestions. His peculiar
incantations to the patient to inspire confidence and induce the patient
to think he was getting well, often worked, as it works in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="p349" id="p349">[349]</a></span>
of quack doctors and credulous white men. The young man who
had the proper dream following the period of fasting in his youth,
predicting his predilection towards the medicine man’s profession,
was taken through a rigorous course of training. Individual knowledge
was handed down through the family. Instruction to boys and
girls usually comes from the uncle or aunt, and if they have no natural
uncle or aunt, then one is assigned to them. This is considered the
closest relationship among Wisconsin Indians, and when one is adopted
into the tribe and given a medicine bag, it will be through the sponsorship
of an uncle for his nephew. Among the Ojibwe, both at Lac du
Flambeau and at Lac Court Oreilles, the writer is known as Shagashkandawe
“Flying Squirrel,” which they say was the name of a
famous old chief and medicine man.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe still use the songs essential to digging medicine roots.
Jack Doud, the old scout captain of the Civil War, of the old Flambeau
village, told the writer that Winabojo, their deity, had received the
seeds of all plants from Dzhe Manido, the creator of the universe,
and that Winabojo had given them to Nokomis, grandmother, the
Earth, to keep in her bosom, for the use of the Indians. Jack Doud
also said that Winabojo took some of the native foods from his own
body. He said that Winabojo pulled out a little pinch of flesh and
threw it on the ground telling it to grow there as <i>mandamin</i> or corn
for the Indians. Another pinch yielded squash, another beans and
so on until Winabojo had very little flesh left on his body. In other
words, the Indians did not know the sources of their cultivated crops,
and had invented this tradition to attempt to explain their presence.</p>

<p>As with other Algonkians, the Ojibwe place tobacco in the
cavity from which they dig the root, as an offering to Grandmother
Earth, to Winabojo, and to Dzhe Manido, praying in song to
these deities to make their chosen medicine potent. The medicine
man or woman is usually distinguished by two long braids of hair
over either shoulder. They are usually shrewd diagnosticians, and
depend upon their senses for discovering the ailment. They feel the
pulse rate, look at the pupils of the eyes, at the condition of the tongue,
at the complexion variation, feel the body temperature and inquire
where the pain is felt. From these symptoms they diagnose the disease.
Usually they want time to dream over the case, and drink a
draught of their own dream-inducing medicine before going to sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p350" id="p350">[350]</a></span>
In a vision or dream, they are directed to the proper medicine to use,
and concoct it the following day. External afflictions are treated with
lotions or poultices, while internal troubles are almost invariably
treated with a medicinal tea. The ingredients are steeped in lukewarm
water, and copious draughts are prescribed several times a day.
The writer has taken such draughts of various medicines and finds
them not unpleasant to the taste. Bitter and nauseous ingredients are
usually disguised by “seasoners” which they add to make them taste
good. The time alloted for a cure is usually four days, their sacred
number, and unless there is marked improvement in the patient at
the end of that period, the medicine man will change the treatment.</p>

<p>Some of the medicine men have “tattooing outfits”, which are
not really tattooing outfits as we understand the term, but rather
blood-letting instruments. Sharp fish teeth are mounted at the end
of a four or five-inch stick, and with a quick stroke on the upper side
of the elbow or near the collar bone the blood is caused to gush out.
The patient holds the arm out tensely while lying down and when the
artery is tapped the blood spurts out rapidly. A tourniquet is applied
to the upper arm when the medicine man thinks enough blood has
flowed and the medicine man then sucks out the residue. The wound
is then bandaged and the tourniquet removed. It is the thought of
the medicine man that it is necessary to let out a certain amount of
bad blood, so that the remaining blood in the patient’s body can be
more easily purified by his heart and his breathing.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe also believe that the medicine man can make bad
medicine as well as good, and can prescribe certain medicines from
his medicine bundle that will enable him to get the better of his
enemies. They had many hunting charms which were supposed to
help them get game. The hunter in using these would often trace
the outline of the desired game upon the ground drawing a line to its
heart. He would then pierce the heart with the line and put the proper
medicine on the heart puncture indicated. A similar procedure might
be followed against human enemies. Such practices were always
kept a deep secret, becoming valueless should anyone see the perpetrator
making the figure. They were likewise deprecated and resented
by the tribe and punishment was apt to follow anyone caught in
such a practice, which all agreed was a perversion of the grand medicine
society teachings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p351" id="p351">[351]</a></span>
Most of the remedies of the medicine men were kept tied in little
bits of cloth, compounded and ready to steep for use. Combinations
of nine to twelve herbs are common. These have been ground
with a mortar and pestle until it would be difficult to identify the
ingredients of the prepared medicines. Even if one knew all of the
ingredients, the amounts of each herb would be difficult to ascertain.
Often, as in the case of Sweet Flag (<i>Acorus calamus</i>), the amount
must be very limited since the medicinal effect is so severe.</p>

<p>The medicine men are taught that their medicines have a great
value and will not be efficacious if disposed of cheaply. Since money
is not so plentiful they are quite willing to accept pay in valuable
goods. This may be a pony, so many blankets, so much wild rice or
whatever the patient has of value. The patient usually calls the
medicine man for ailments that have not responded to his own individual
treatment. When the patient pays what the medicine man
thinks is proper, then he may be told what was used to effect the cure,
and how and when to gather the ingredients and how to administer
the remedy. The recipient is admonished to see that he does not impart
the knowledge unless he is well paid for it, as he paid the medicine
man. This explains the difficulty one encounters when he tries to
get medicinal information. Only by completely securing the confidence
of the Indians, can a white man get this information without
pay, and then it must be thoroughly understood that the investigator
is not copying their medicines to take commercial advantage of
this knowledge. The Indian is quick to appreciate favors and to
acknowledge the respect that is given to him by the white man, and
becomes quite confident when he realizes that his confidence is not
abused.</p>

<h3><a name="MEDICINAL_MATERIALS" id="MEDICINAL_MATERIALS"></a>OJIBWE MEDICINAL MATERIALS</h3>

<p>While the Ojibwe use a few remedies outside the plant kingdom,
they are not of such great importance as among some other tribes.
These are here considered first, the plants following under the proper
families alphabetically.</p>

<h4><a name="OTHER_THAN_PLANTS" id="OTHER_THAN_PLANTS"></a>OTHER THAN PLANTS</h4>

<h5>REPTILES</h5>

<p><b>Rattlesnake</b>, “jicigwe”. The flesh of the rattlesnake commonly
known as the massasauga rattler, is sometimes used in combination
with other medicines, for its lubricant effect, similar to Russian mineral
oil. The Plains Indians and those farther south in the United
States consider rattlesnake meat quite efficient in making childbirth
easier.</p>

<h5>FISH</h5>

<p><b>Sturgeon</b>, “namê”. Fine teeth of the sturgeon were said to be
used to make the “tattooing” tool employed by the medicine man in
blood-letting. Large fish bladders, “pîkwadj”, were sometimes used as
syringes; a hollow duck bone bound with sinew in the end of it, being
used for anal applications.</p>

<h5>MINERALS</h5>

<p><b>White Clay</b>, “wabaˈbîgan”. White clay was sometimes mixed
with medicinal powders to make them into pellets or pills, and the
clay was supposed to be a medicine, too, but for what purpose we
were unable to discover. Red Clay “osaˈman” was also used in
fabricating poultices and was supposed to help draw out the inflammation.</p>

<h5>MAMMALS</h5>

<p><b>Bear</b>, “mûkwo”. Bear’s fat was used in several compounds.
Melted alone and swallowed it became a drastic physic. Buds of the
Balsam Poplar (<i>Populus balsamifera</i>) and the Large-toothed Poplar
(<i>Populus grandidentata</i>) stewed in bear fat, yielded an aromatic
salve that was used in curing ear-ache, soothing boils, and healing
wounds and ulcers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p353" id="p353">[353]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="MEDICINAL_PLANTS" id="MEDICINAL_PLANTS"></a>OJIBWE MEDICINAL PLANTS</h4>

<h5>ACERACEAE (MAPLE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Box Elder</b> (<i>Acer negundo</i> L.), “adjagobiˈmûk”, shown in <a href="#plate68">plate 68</a>,
fig. 2. The Pillager Band of Ojibwe reported that the inner bark
of the box-elder is steeped to make an emetic. There is no record of
its use by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Red Maple</b> (<i>Acer rubrum</i> L.) “cicigîmeˈwîc”, shown in <a href="#plate65">plate 65</a>,
fig. 1. The Flambeau Ojibwe boil the bark of the red maple to
obtain a tea with which to wash and cure sore eyes. There is no record
of its use by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Mountain Maple</b> (<i>Acer spicatum</i> Lam.) “cacagobiˈmûk”
[emetic bark]. The Pillager Ojibwe extract the pith of the twig and
pinch off small particles which are put into the eye like flax seed to
remove foreign matter. It becomes sticky and holds foreign matter
which can then be removed with the pith. The pith is also soaked in
water to make a lotion for treating sore eyes. Among the whites,
Mountain Maple bark is often gathered and sold for Cramp Bark
(<i>Viburnum opulus</i> L. var. <i>americanum</i> [Mill.] Ait.) In fact, it has
often been wholly substituted for it, and seems about as effective
as a uterine sedative and preventative of abortion.</p>

<h5>ALISMACEAE (WATER-PLANTAIN FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Arum-leaved Arrowhead</b> (<i>Sagittaria arifolia</i> Nutt.) “wabasiˈ
pîn” [white potato].<a name="FNanchor_92_8" id="FNanchor_92_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_8" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Upon short lateral rootlets, amongst the mass
of fibrous roots of the arrowhead, firm corms develop, pinkish-white
and bulb-shaped, but solid and composed of a sweetish, starchy
texture. These are the choice Indian potatoes. These corms
break away from the root mass very easily so that the utmost care
is necessary in digging to get them <i>in situ</i>. Muskrats are very fond
of them, as are beavers, and sometimes store up large covered
caches, which the Indian recognizes and appropriates. They will
also dig for them, if they cannot be more easily obtained. While they
are chiefly prized for food, they are also taken to be a remedy for
indigestion among the Pillager Ojibwe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p354" id="p354">[354]</a></span></p>

<h5>ANACARDIACEAE (SUMAC FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Smooth Sumac</b> (<i>Rhus glabra</i> L.) “bakwaˈ nak” [binding tree].
According to Jack Doud and other Flambeau Ojibwe all parts of
the Smooth Sumac are suitable for medicine, the root bark, trunk
bark, twig bark, leaves, flowers and fruit. The root bark tea is used as a
hemostatic. Trunk and twig innerbark are used in combination
with other medicine for their astringent qualities. Blossoms are
sometimes steeped for sore eyes, leaves are used in poultices, and the
fruit is considered a throat cleanser as well as being the basis of a
beverage. Eclectic practitioners, or the old time herbalists, used the
berries of <i>Rhus glabra</i> because of the malic acid in the skin, claiming
it to be a good gargle in acute throat inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Staghorn Sumac</b> (<i>Rhus typhina</i> L.) “bakwanaˈ tîg” [binding
tree].<a name="FNanchor_93_9" id="FNanchor_93_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_9" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The Staghorn Sumac was absent from the Flambeau Ojibwe
territory, but plentiful around Leech Lake, Minnesota, while the
Smooth Sumac was not found near Leech Lake. The Pillager Ojibwe
only used the root as a medicine to stop a hemorrhage. They suggested
that they had heard of it being used in medicinal combinations
but did not know how to make or use them.</p>

<p><b>Poison Ivy</b> (<i>Rhus toxicodendron</i> L.) “anîmîkiˈbûg” [cloud], shown
in <a href="#plate68">plate 68</a>, fig. 1. Mukwean (Bearskin), Flambeau medicine man,
called this a poison to the skin and said that the Ojibwe have no distinctive
name for it. John Peper, one of the Bear Island Pillager
Indians, gave us the Indian name and said that no one now alive there
knew how to use it. Since Kepeosatok, Meskwaki medicine man, at
Tama, Iowa, used it in a certain manner for poulticing some kinds
of swellings, the writer thinks this may be the use to which John
Peper referred.</p>

<h5>APOCYNACEAE (DOGBANE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Spreading Dogbane</b> (<i>Apocynum androsaemifolium</i> L.) “wesaˈ
wûckwûn” [nearly blue flowers] or “magosîñeˈ cnakwûk” [needle-like].<a name="FNanchor_94_10" id="FNanchor_94_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_10" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
Bearskin, Flambeau medicine man, said that the stalk and
root of this plant are steeped to make a tea for women to drink. It
keeps the kidneys free during pregnancy. Other Flambeau Ojibwe
agreed with the use but cited the second name as more correct for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p355" id="p355">[355]</a></span>
Under the Ojibwe name of “mîdewîdjiˈbîk” [medicine lodge root], the
Pillager Ojibwe declared it to be one of the sacred roots that is eaten
during the medicine lodge ceremony. They use it also for throat
trouble. When one has a coated tongue and is afflicted with headache,
the root is also used. In the case of headache, the root is placed
upon live coals and the incense is inhaled.</p>

<h5>AQUIFOLIACEAE (HOLLY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Winterberry</b> (<i>Ilex verticillata</i> [L.] Gray), “aweˈnîsibûg” [wintergreen
leaf], and “anîmûˈcîmînûn” [dog berry]. The bark of this
native holly is medicine among the Flambeau Ojibwe, but the use
could not be discovered, other than that it might be used for diarrhea.
Winterberry has been employed by eclectic practitioners as a tonic
and astringent. It has been substituted for quinine in the treatment
of periodical fevers, and also used in the treatment of diarrhea. The
eclectic practitioner has also used it in treating malignant ulcers and
chronic skin eruptions.</p>

<p><b>Mountain Holly</b> (<i>Nemopanthus mucronata</i> [L.] Trel.), “mîckimînûˈ
nîmîc” [red berry tree], shown in <a href="#plate65">plate 65</a>, fig. 2. This bush
is very common around the reservation of the Flambeau Ojibwe and
the berries are used as medicine, but the writer was unable to discover
for what disease or how used. There is no record of its use
among the whites.</p>

<h5>ARACEAE (ARUM FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Sweet Flag</b> (<i>Acorus calamus</i> L.) “naˈ bûgûck” [something flat].
The root of Sweet Flag is a quick acting physic, supposed to act in
half a day. Bearskin cautioned the writer that no more than one
and a half inches was to be used, as more would make one ill, and even
this much is quite harsh. The Pillager Ojibwe recognize the Sweet Flag
under the name “weˈke”, which is the same word used by another tribe
for the Yellow Water-lily, and by another for the Blue Flag. John Peper
said that the root was used for curing a cold in the throat or for curing
a cramp in the stomach. In earlier days, among the whites, slices
were candied to create a more popular form of medication. It was
formerly used among the white men as a tonic for dyspepsia and for
correcting flatulent colic. It was also supposed to be beneficial as a
mild stimulant in typhoid cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p356" id="p356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Indian Turnip</b> (<i>Arisaema triphyllum</i> [L.] Schott.), “cacaˈ gomîn.”<a name="FNanchor_95_11" id="FNanchor_95_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_11" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The root of Indian Turnip was said by John Peper, Bear Island
Ojibwe, to be used in treating sore eyes, but he did not know how to
use it. One wonders if the calcium oxalate crystals so firefull to the
mouth lining were equally so to the delicate membranes of the eye.</p>

<p>Small doses of the partially dried root have been used by the
white man in the treatment of chronic bronchitis, asthma, flatulent
colic and rheumatism, certainly widely different maladies. The juice
of the fresh corm in lard has been used by the white man as a local
application to cure ringworm.</p>

<h5>ARALIACEAE (GINSENG FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Wild Sarsaparilla</b> (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> L.) “bebamabiˈ k” [root
runs far through the ground]. The Flambeau Ojibwe recognize the
root of this plant as a strong medicine, but do not steep it to make tea.
The fresh root is pounded and applied as a poultice to bring a boil
to a head or to cure a carbuncle. Among the Pillager Ojibwe, the
writer found two names applied to this, one of which he thinks to be a
case of mistaken identification by the informant. “O kadak” [wild
carrot] is more likely to refer to <i>Aralia racemosa</i> though no specimens
were found there. They used it under this name as a special squaw
remedy for blood purification during pregnancy. The root was
pounded in a mortar, then boiled in hot water. Under their name
“waboˈ s ûskwe” [rabbit] the root was prepared the same way and
the tea was used to cure a cough.</p>

<p>Among the white men, this root has the same properties and uses
as the Indian Spikenard (<i>Aralia racemosa</i>); namely, stimulant, diaphoretic,
and alterative.</p>

<p><b>Ginseng</b> (<i>Panax quinquefolium</i> L.) “<i>jîssêˈns.</i>” Evidently the
word they used was an attempt to pronounce the white man’s term
for it. The writer was unable to discover any medical use made
of it by the Ojibwe, though they gathered it assiduously for sale to the
traders. Their method of gathering was a thoughtful one. Although
they undoubtedly recognized it in any stage of growth, they only
gathered the root when the red berries were mature, but before they
were ready to drop. Into the hole from whence the root came, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="p357" id="p357">[357]</a></span>
would thrust the whole fruiting top, and carefully firm the soil upon
it. Knowing the location well, they would revisit the place in three
to five years and find more roots than they harvested in the first
instance.</p>

<p>According to our pharmacopoeia, the medicinal value of ginseng
is almost nothing, but there is a great market for it in China, where it
is worshipped as a sort of fetish, and is acclaimed as a panacea for
sexual impotency, nervousness, vomiting and dyspepsia. The more
nearly the root approximates the human torso, the more valuable
it is to the Chinese. Thus one root in a six hundred-pound bale may
be worth many times the entire remainder of the bale, and when ten
dollars a pound is the price, one can realize the extreme value of such
a piece.</p>

<h5>ARISTOLOCHIACEAE (BIRTHWORT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Wild Ginger</b> (<i>Asarum canadense</i> L. var. <i>acuminatum</i> Ashe.)
“nameˈ pîn” [sturgeon potato].<a name="FNanchor_96_12" id="FNanchor_96_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_12" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe called this a
potato for sick people. They are supposed to chew the root, and then
they can eat anything they desire.</p>

<p>The white man calls this Canada Snakeroot in his dispensatories,
considering it a feeble remedy with tonic, aromatic and diuretic
properties. Cases of convalescent acute febrile infections are sometimes
given the extract of wild ginger root.</p>

<h5>ASCLEPIADACEAE (MILKWEED FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Common Milkweed</b> (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i> L.) “caboˈ sîkûn” [milk]
or “înîniˈwûnj” [Indian plant], according to Flambeau Ojibwe.<a name="FNanchor_97_13" id="FNanchor_97_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_13" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Although
the Pillager Ojibwe used this chiefly for food, the root was
also used as a female remedy, but for what phase of illness, we were
not able to discover. Eclectic practitioners have used the roots as
counter-irritants or internally as stomachics, carminatives, or anti-spasmodics
of the stimulating class.</p>

<h5>BALSAMINACEAE (TOUCH-ME-NOT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Spotted Touch-me-not</b> (<i>Impatiens biflora</i> Walt.) “wesaˈ wûs
gaˈskonêk” [yellow light]. Bearskin, Flambeau medicine man said<span class="pagenum"><a name="p358" id="p358">[358]</a></span>
that the fresh juice of this plant rubbed on the head would cure a
headache. The leaves are steeped for a medicinal tea, but the ailment
was undiscovered.</p>

<p>The herbage of this plant, under the name Wild Celadine, has
been largely employed by homoeopathic physicians and eclectics. The
chemical constituents are not known though the leaves apparently
contain tannin. The medicinal value is questionable, though fresh
applications of the juice appear to relieve skin irritations of various
kinds, especially that of Poison Ivy.</p>

<h5>BERBERIDACEAE (BARBERRY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Blue Cohosh</b> (<i>Caulophyllum thalictroides</i> [L.] Michx). “ociˈ
gîmîc”.<a name="FNanchor_98_14" id="FNanchor_98_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_14" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the root for female troubles especially
for cramps in the stomach during painful menstruation. The
fine roots are also boiled to make a tea for emetic purposes. White
people seldom use it. Eclectics have used it in the treatment of
hysteria and uterine diseases. They have claimed that it will prevent
abortion, by causing uterine contraction when uterine inertia
is present.</p>

<h5>BETULACEAE (BIRCH FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Speckled Alder</b> (<i>Alnus incana</i> [L.] Moench.) “wadoˈ bîn” [root
to sew a canoe]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root for its hemostatic
qualities. When one passes blood in his stools, the root tea will act
as an astringent and coagulant.</p>

<p>The white man has also used alder bark for its mild astringent
properties. The eclectic practitioner in the United States and
Canada employed it in a powdered condition for dusting upon chafed
body surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Paper Birch</b> (<i>Betula alba</i> [L.] var. <i>papyrifera</i> [Marsh.] Spach.)
“wîgwas”. From “wîgwas” comes the word “wigwam” or house, because
birch bark was used in covering the house, furnishing a waterproof
roof. The root of the Paper Birch was used in medicines as a seasoner.
Its sweetish, aromatic, wintergreen flavor disguised less pleasant
doses. The root bark and maple sugar cooked together made a soothing
syrup to alleviate cramps in the stomach. The white man has
employed only the leaves medicinally as a diuretic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p359" id="p359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Low Birch</b> (<i>Betula pumila</i> L. var. <i>glandulifera</i> Regel.) “bîneˈ
mîcins” [partridge tips]. Among the Pillager Ojibwe, the Low Birch is a
valued source of medicine. Although it is plentiful around the Flambeau
Reservation, none of them seemed to consider it medicine, although
their name agreed, “bîneˈ mîc”, without the diminutive. The
Pillager Ojibwe use the tiny cones upon a plate of coals as an incense
to cure catarrh. No doubt the resinous covering of the twigs and
cones in this variety causes the aromatic incense. Also a tea made
from the cones is drunk by women in their menses. Such tea is also
accounted strengthening when the patient is enfeebled by childbirth.
The leaves probably possess diuretic properties as do other species
of <i>Betula</i>. No record of its use by white men has been discovered.</p>

<p><b>Hazelnut</b> (<i>Corylus americana</i> Walt.) “mûkwobagaˈ nak” [bear
nut].<a name="FNanchor_99_15" id="FNanchor_99_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_15" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Bearskin said that the bark of the hazelnut bush is medicine.
It is boiled and used as a poultice on cuts to close and heal them. No
record of its medical use by white men has been discovered.</p>

<p><b>Beaked Hazelnut</b> (<i>Corylus rostrata</i> Ait.), “bagaˈn” or “bagaˈnak”
[nut] Flambeau names, and “bagaˈnamijic” [nut tree], Pillager name.
Bearskin assigned the same properties and uses to the bark of the
Beaked Hazelnut as to the Hazelnut. The Pillager Ojibwe used only
the hairs of the hazelnut husk as a medicine to expel worms. Eclectic
practitioners have used it in the same manner as an anthelmintic,
depending probably on the irritant effect of the tiny stickers.</p>

<h5>BORAGINACEAE (BORAGE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Hound’s Tongue</b> (<i>Cynoglossum boreale</i> Fernald), “masaˈn”.
Three terms are used to denote the action of such plants as this,
which are burned upon live coals that the patient may inhale the
fumes. They are: “abaˈ bûson”,—to revive or “head standing by
smoke”; “sasaˈ bîkwat”,—to snuff it; and “nokweˈ sîkûn”,—“smell as
it comes”. They are used interchangeably in designating the use of
the plant. Hound’s Tongue is specifically fumed to cure a headache.</p>

<p>Among the whites, Hound’s Tongue has been recommended as
a sedative and demulcent in the treatment of bronchial and pulmonary
affections. It is said to be of value also in dysentery. The fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="p360" id="p360">[360]</a></span>
leaves are used locally as a remedy for superficial burns and abraded
surfaces.</p>

<h5>CAMPANULACEAE (BELLFLOWER FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Marsh Bellflower</b> (<i>Campanula aparinoides</i> Pursh.) Although
plentiful around the Lac du Flambeau region, our informants said
that this is not used.</p>

<p><b>Harebell</b> (<i>Campanula rotundifolia</i> L.) “adotaˈgons” [little bell].
The Pillager Ojibwe use the root of the Harebell combined with three
other unnamed roots for lung troubles. There is no record of its
use by whites.</p>

<h5>CAPRIFOLIACEAE (HONEYSUCKLE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Bush Honeysuckle</b> (<i>Diervilla lonicera</i> Mill.), “osawaˈ skanet”
[yellow fluid]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root together with
other plants such as the Ground Pine, for their most valued urinary
remedy. It is also known among white men as a diuretic and a remedy
to relieve itching.</p>

<p><b>Red Elderberry</b> (<i>Sambucus racemosa</i> L.), “papaskatcîksiˈganaˈtîg”
[popgun wood]. According to the Pillager Ojibwe, this
bark is an emetic or a purgative, depending upon how it is prepared
for use. It is a last resort purgative to be used when other remedies
for the same complaint are of no avail. It may be said that the Ojibwe
have more plants for physic than for any other purpose, thus the Red
Elder will be seen to be their most important one.</p>

<p>Four internodes of the stalk are taken, because four is their magic
number. These sections are measured carefully from the point of
the ulna to the point of the humerus. The inner bark is secured by
peeling downward. This is steeped and boiled, and the resulting
liquid is drunk for constipation. It is supposed to thus save the life
of one threatened with serious constipation. It is reserved for extreme
cases, because of the many other physics they employ, and they consider
it drastic and dangerous otherwise. If these same four sticks
had been peeled upwards and the resulting tea drunk, then it would
have acted as a powerful emetic. The writer can testify to its strength,
but notes that it works both ways at once, no matter how prepared,
so that the method of preparation is doubtless superstitious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p361" id="p361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the whites only the elder flowers are recognized in the
New Formulary, but the inner bark has been known to produce death
in children, a short time after being eaten, with symptoms similar to
Poison Hemlock (<i>Cicuta</i>). In moderate doses, it is also known to
produce vomiting and purging. The active alkaloid evidently works
only in the fresh state, as it loses its potency in a dried state.</p>

<p><b>Snowberry</b> (<i>Symphoricarpos racemosus</i> Michx.) “anîgomijiˈ mînagaˈwûnj”
[little crow bush]. Among the Pillager Ojibwe, the root
of the Snowberry is used to make a tea to clear up the afterbirth, and
enable quicker convalescence. Among the Meskwaki Indians the
same use is ascribed to the Wolfberry (<i>Symphoricarpos occidentalis</i>).
There is no record of its use by white men.</p>

<p><b>Nannyberry</b> (<i>Viburnum lentago</i> L.), “atîteˈ tamînûn” or “atîteˈ
tamînagaˈwûnj.”<a name="FNanchor_100_16" id="FNanchor_100_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_16" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe collect the inner bark of
the trunk, down low next to the ground, to yield a tea which is used
as a diuretic.</p>

<p>Among the white men, Nannyberry is often sold as <i>Viburnum
prunifolium</i> which is official in our pharmacopoeia. The virtues assigned
to this class of medicine are as feeble as they are numerous.
It has been used as a nervine, astringent, tonic, diuretic and has been
said to have value as an uterine sedative and preventive of abortion.</p>

<p><b>Highbush Cranberry</b> (<i>Viburnum opulus</i> L. var. <i>americanum</i>
[Mill.] Ait.) “aˈnibîmîˈnûgaˈwûck” [anib means elm, berries, bush].<a name="FNanchor_101_17" id="FNanchor_101_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_17" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
The Pillager Ojibwe used the inner bark as a physic, and also drank
the tea to cure cramps in the stomach.</p>

<p>Among the white men, <i>Viburnum opulus</i> is considered to be the
same as <i>Viburnum prunifolium</i>, only less potent. It is recommended
as an antispasmodic in asthma, hysteria, puerperal convulsions, and
dysmenorrhea.</p>

<h5>CARYOPHYLLACEAE (PINK FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>White Campion</b> (<i>Lychnis alba</i> Mill.) “basiˈ bûgûk” [small leaf].
The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root of this for a tea to physic a patient.
There is no record of its use by white men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p362" id="p362">[362]</a></span></p>

<h5>CELASTRACEAE (STAFF TREE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Climbing Bittersweet</b> (<i>Celastrus scandens</i> L.) “manîdobimaˈ
kwît” [spirit-twisted]. The Pillager Ojibwe use the red berries of
this plant for stomach trouble.</p>

<p>The white man uses the berries for decorative purposes, and has
used the bark for emetic, diaphoretic and antisyphilitic purposes.</p>

<h5>COMPOSITAE (COMPOSITE FAMILY)</h5>

<p>The composite family is represented by many species in northern
Wisconsin and also in northern Minnesota. There are probably three
times as many plants in this family as in any other, hence it furnishes
numerous medicines.</p>

<p><b>Woolly Yarrow</b> (<i>Achillea lanulosa</i> Nutt.), “waˈ bîgwûn” [white-flower].
The Flambeau Ojibwe, under the name given, use the leaves
of this plant as a poultice to cure the bite of a spider. The dried
flowering heads are smoked in mixture with other things, much as
kinnikinnik, not for pleasure, but more for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<p>It has not been distinguished by the eclectic practitioner from the
Common Yarrow, which was used for its bitter and aromatic principles.
It was used as an emmenagogue and for various ailments of the reproductive
organs. It was sometimes used to cure diseased conditions
of the entire gastro-intestinal tract.</p>

<p><b>Yarrow</b> (<i>Achillea millefolium</i> L.), “adjidamoˈ anûk” [squirrel
tail].<a name="FNanchor_102_18" id="FNanchor_102_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_18" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe used the florets in ceremonial smoking
and placed them on a bed of coals inhaling the smoke to break a
fever.</p>

<p>Yarrow has always been a home remedy of the white man, and
the Germans still use the dried flowers in a tea, called “schafesgarbetee”,
to break a fever. Other uses are the same as above.</p>

<p><b>Pearly Everlasting</b> (<i>Anaphalis margaritacea</i> [L.] B. &amp; H.), “basiˈ
bagûk” [small leaf]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the flowers of this
plant, calling attention to the fact that it smells like acorns, reducing
them to a powder which is sprinkled on live coals as a “nokweˈ sîgûn”
or perfume. This is inhaled by a party who has had a stroke of paralysis
and is said to revive him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p363" id="p363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pearly Everlasting has never been properly analyzed by white
men, but the flowers have been locally used by them as soothing expectorants
and are known to have more or less marked stomachic
properties.</p>

<p><b>Lesser Cat’s-Foot</b> (<i>Antennaria neodioica</i> Greene) “gagîgeˈ bûg”
[everlasting leaf]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the whole herb as a
valued remedy to make a tea to be given to the mother after child
birth. It is to purge the afterbirth and heal them internally.</p>

<p>Eclectic practitioners have used this plant as a hemostatic.</p>

<p><b>Common Burdock</b> (<i>Arctium minus</i> Bernh.), “giˈ masan” [big
stickers]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root of burdock as one of
the ingredients of a medicine for pain in the stomach. It is also supposed
to have a tonic effect.</p>

<p>Burdock root has quite a reputation among home practitioners
among the white men as a diaphoretic, diuretic, alterative, aperient
and depurative. It has been used for rheumatism, gout, pulmonary
catarrh, chronic skin diseases such as scrofula and syphilis, and to
dissolve urinary deposits. Externally it has been used as a salve or
wash for eruptions, burns, wounds, hemorrhoids and swelling.</p>

<p><b>White Sage</b> (<i>Artemisia ludoviciana</i> Nutt.) “îmbjîˈgoa” according
to White Cloud, Bear Island Ojibwe, but “wîngûskw” or “bebejiˈgogaˈnji”
[horse medicine] by John Peper, another Bear Islander.
Peper said the Pillager Ojibwe used it as a horse medicine, but the
Sioux smoked it.</p>

<p>Miners and frontiersmen prized it in their treatment of “mountain
fevers.”</p>

<p><b>Large-leaved Aster</b> (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i> L.), “naskosiˈ îcûs”.
The Flambeau Ojibwe consider this a feeble remedy but also good as
a charm in hunting. Young roots were used to make a tea to bathe
the head for headache. The informant giving this latter use called it
“megîsiˈ bûg” [eagle leaf]. There is no record of its use by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Ox-eye Daisy</b> (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i> L.). The Flambeau
Ojibwe had no name for this, as they said it was from the south,
and they do not use it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p364" id="p364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Canada Thistle</b> (<i>Cirsium arvense</i> [L.] Scop.) “masaˈ nûck”
[prickly]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the plant for a bowel tonic.
Canada Thistle is one of the worst American weeds, and white men
have used the dried plant for a diuretic and tonic.</p>

<p><b>Common Thistle</b> (<i>Cirsium lanceolatum</i> [L.] Hill), “jiˈ masaˈnûck”.
The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root of this for alleviating
stomach cramps in both men and women. The dried plant has been
used by the whites as a diuretic and tonic.</p>

<p><b>Philadelphia Fleabane</b> (<i>Erigeron philadelphicus</i> L.) “mîcaoˈgacan”
[odor of deer hoof]. The Pillager Ojibwe use the flowers
to make a tea to break fevers. The smoke of the dried flowers is
inhaled to cure a cold in the head. The disk flowers, pulverized, were
snuffed up the nostrils to cause the patient to sneeze and thus loosen
a cold in the head. The whites have used the Canada Fleabane as a
remedy in the pharmacopoeia, and also have used the Philadelphia
Fleabane locally, but for different purposes. It is diuretic rather
than astringent.</p>

<p><b>Daisy Fleabane</b> (<i>Erigeron ramosus</i> [Walt.] BSP). The Flambeau
Ojibwe do not assign this plant a special name but class it as a “nokweˈ
sîgûn” or perfume for curing sick headache. Several species of <i>Erigeron</i>
have been substituted by white men for the Canada Fleabane, which
is used as a diaphoretic and expectorant.</p>

<p><b>Joe-Pye Weed</b> (<i>Eupatorium purpureum</i> L.), “bûˈ gîsowe” [bathing].
The Flambeau Ojibwe make a strong solution of the root, with
which to wash a papoose up till the time he is six years old. This is
supposed to strengthen him.</p>

<p>Joe-Pye is officinal but not official among white men. Official
designates that it is authorized by the U. S. Pharmacopoeia while
officinal means that it is regularly kept for sale in drug stores. Officinal
remedies are much used by eclectic practitioners. The root has
the odor of old hay and is diuretic, stimulant, astringent and tonic.
It has been used in chronic urinary disorders, gout, rheumatism, and
hematuria.</p>

<p><b>Tall Blue Lettuce</b> (<i>Lactuca spicata</i> [Lam.] Hitchc.), “dadocaˈbo”
[milk]. The Flambeau Ojibwe employ the plant to make a tea given<span class="pagenum"><a name="p365" id="p365">[365]</a></span>
to women with caked breasts to render lactation easier. A dog whisker
hair is used to pierce the teat. Among white men <i>Lactuca</i> was formerly
employed as a soporific and sedative.</p>

<p><b>White Lettuce</b> (<i>Prenanthus alba</i> L.), “wecaˈ wûs waˈ ckwînêsk”
[yellow light]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the milk of the White Lettuce
as a diuretic, especially in female diseases. The root is also used as a
female remedy.</p>

<p>White men have used the root decoction internally for dysentery.
Old time herb doctors gave the milk of the plant internally, and used
the leaves, steeped in hot water, as a poultice for the bite of a snake.</p>

<p><b>Black-eyed Susan</b> (<i>Rudbeckia hirta</i> L.). The Flambeau Ojibwe
claim that this plant is adventive from the south and have no name
or use for it. It has been used by the white men as a diuretic.</p>

<p><b>Golden Ragwort</b> (<i>Senecio aureus</i> L.).</p>

<p><b>Entire-leaved Groundsel</b> (<i>Senecio integerrimus</i> Nutt.) Both
of these plants are considered adventive by the Pillager Ojibwe and
neither was named nor used.</p>

<p>Under the name squaw weed, white men have exploited the Golden
Ragwort as a female regulator, claiming diuretic, pectoral, diaphoretic
and tonic properties. It is also said to be useful in treating gravel
and other urinary affections.</p>

<p><b>Indian Cup Plant</b> (<i>Silphium perfoliatum</i> L.), “asasaˈ weskûk”
[square stem]. According to John White Feather, of the Flambeau
Ojibwe, this root was carried from Iowa and transplanted on the Lac
du Flambeau Ojibwe Reservation. They all accept it as great medicine.
A tea is made from the root for lumbago and some other kinds of
rheumatic pains in the back. John Peper, Pillager Ojibwe, gave it the
same Indian name and said that an old Indian had brought it to Bear
Island from Iowa a hundred years ago, and had planted it in his field,
whence it escaped to the south end of the island. He said they use it
for stomach trouble, and hemorrhage. White men have used the Indian
Cup Plant root for its tonic, diaphoretic and alterative properties.
It has also been used in intermittent fevers, ulcers, liver affections and
debility. The resinous gum collected from the stem has been used by
the whites as a stimulant and antispasmodic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p366" id="p366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fragrant Golden-rod</b> (<i>Solidago graminifolia</i> [L.] Salisb.), “wasaˈ
waskwûneˈk” [yellow light]. Besides being of use in hunting medicine,
the flowers in infusion were used by the Flambeau Ojibwe for a pain in
the chest.</p>

<p>Golden-rod leaves and flowers have at times held a rather important
place in materia medica, for their carminative, and antispasmodic
properties. They have also been used as an intestinal
astringent.</p>

<p><b>Tansy</b> (<i>Tanacetum vulgare</i> L.) “muckikiˈwît” [medicine]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe have no distinctive name for this plant, claiming
it came from the south and they were told it was good for fevers.</p>

<p>Among white men, it is deemed tonic, emmenagogue and diaphoretic.
It has been used in a cold infusion in convalescence from
exhausting diseases, dyspepsia, hysteria and jaundice.</p>

<p><b>Dandelion</b> (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i> Weber) “wesaˈusakwûnek” [yellow
light].<a name="FNanchor_103_19" id="FNanchor_103_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_19" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> While the Flambeau Ojibwe do not use this plant, the
Pillager Ojibwe give it a name and use the root for a tea for heartburn.
It was found growing at the north end of Bear Island in Leech
Lake, Minnesota.</p>

<p>Among the whites, the virtues of the root are much overrated. The
dried root is steeped in boiling water and is used as a stomachic and
tonic, with slight diuretic and aperient action.</p>

<p><b>Cocklebur</b> (<i>Xanthium commune</i> Britton), “sakatiˈkomûk”
[stickers]. Although giving it a name, the Flambeau Ojibwe did not
use it. It has been used by white men in intermittent fevers, also as a
diuretic, diaphoretic and sialagogue.</p>

<h5>CORNACEAE (DOGWOOD FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Alternate-leaved Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i> L. f.) “mosoˈmîc”
[moose tree].<a name="FNanchor_104_20" id="FNanchor_104_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_20" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the inner bark for an
emetic. Although other species of <i>Cornus</i> are officinal with white
men, there is no record of the use of this species.</p>

<p><b>Bunchberry</b> (<i>Cornus canadensis</i> L.) “odeˈ imînîdjiˈ bîk” [strawberry
root, or heart-berry root]. The Bunchberry or Dwarf Cornel<span class="pagenum"><a name="p367" id="p367">[367]</a></span>
somewhat resembles the Wild Strawberry. The Flambeau Ojibwe
make a tea from the root, which is used to cure babies of colic. There
is no record of its medicinal use by the whites, though it has been eaten
by them.</p>

<p><b>Panicled Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus paniculata</i> L’Her.), “meskwabiˈ
mîc” [red bush]. It is peculiar that the Flambeau Ojibwe would call
this a red bush, for the branches are distinctly gray. Only the fruit
stalks or pedicels are bright red. The bark is used as a tea for flux. An
aggregate of this bark compressed into a stopper shape is forced
into the anus as a treatment for piles. There is no record of its use by
the whites.</p>

<h5>CRUCIFERAE (MUSTARD FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Tower Mustard</b> (<i>Arabis glabra</i> [L.] Bernh.), “misodjidamoˈ
anûk” [black squirrel tail]. Although the Pillager Ojibwe have a
name for this plant, they say it is from the south, and they do not
use it. There is no record of its use by white men.</p>

<p><b>Marsh Cress</b> (<i>Radicula palustris</i> [L.] var. <i>hispida</i> [Desv.] Robinson),
“wabîgwûn” [yellow flower]. The Flambeau Ojibwe name for
Marsh Cress is not very distinctive although it does have yellowish
flowers. They have no use for the plant as it came in from the south,
according to them. Neither have white men.</p>

<p><b>Tansy-mustard</b> (<i>Sisymbrium canescens</i> Nutt.) The Pillager
Ojibwe do not know this plant, which they consider to be adventive
from the south and do not use it. Aside from the fact that the seeds
have a volatile oil similar to mustard seed, the whites do not use it.</p>

<h5>CUCURBITACEAE (GOURD FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Squash</b> (<i>Cucurbita maxima</i> Duchesne.) “ogwîssiˈmaun oˈwasokwûneˈk”
[threads like hair; yellow light]. The Flambeau Ojibwe used
the seed tea as a diuretic. There is no distinctive medicinal use of
squash among the whites.</p>

<p><b>Wild Balsam-apple</b> (<i>Echinocystis lobata</i> [Michx.] T. &amp; G.) “nîgîtîniˈ
gûnûk” or “mîtcigiˈ mênûk” [man in the ground], shown in
<a href="#plate69">plate 69</a>, fig. 1. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root tea as a bitter
medicine for stomach troubles and as a tonic. The root is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="p368" id="p368">[368]</a></span>
bitter enough. On the west coast, the root has been employed by
white men as a simple bitter.</p>

<h5>CYPERACEAE (SEDGE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Hare’s Tail</b> (<i>Eriophorum callitrix</i> Cham.) “bîweeˈ ckînûk” [fuzz
of fruit]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the matted fuzz as a hemostatic.
Under the name “mesadiˈ wackons” [little catkins from
popple], the Pillager Ojibwe refer to it, but none of them knew any
use for it. There has been a limited use of its tannic properties as an
astringent by white men.</p>

<h5>EQUISETACEAE (HORSETAIL FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Field Horsetail</b> (<i>Equisetum arvense</i> L.) “gîjiˈ bînûsk,” [duck
round].<a name="FNanchor_105_21" id="FNanchor_105_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_21" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the whole plant to make a tea
to cure the dropsy. The plant has been used indefinitely chiefly
in domestic practice by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Wood Horsetail</b> (<i>Equisetum sylvaticum</i> L.), “sibaˈ mûckûn”.
The Pillager Ojibwe use the whole plant to make a tea to cure kidney
trouble and dropsy. It has not been much used by the whites, except
as a domestic remedy for gravel.</p>

<h5>ERICACEAE (HEATH FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Bog Rosemary</b> (<i>Andromeda glaucophylla</i> Link.), “bîneˈ mîkci”
[swamp partridge berry]. The plant was found on the Flambeau
Ojibwe Reservation, but was not used medicinally. Among the whites,
it is credited with poisonous properties.</p>

<p><b>Prince’s Pine</b> (<i>Chimaphila umbellata</i> [L.] Nutt.), “gaˈ gîgeˈbûg”
[everlasting leaf].<a name="FNanchor_106_22" id="FNanchor_106_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_22" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe pronounce the name of
Prince’s Pine nearly the same as the Menomini Indians, and use it
for the same purposes, namely a tea for treating stomach troubles.
<i>Chimaphila</i> is official with white men as a tonic and diuretic. It
stimulates the mucous membrane of the genito-urinary tract, and
has been used in renal dropsy, scrofulous conditions, chronic ulcers
and skin lesions. It is employed both internally and as an embrocation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p369" id="p369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Wintergreen</b> (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i> L.), “wînîsiˈ bûgûd”, [dirty
leaves], shown in <a href="#plate75">plate 75</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the
leaves to brew a tea to cure rheumatism and “to make one feel good.”
The white man discovered the properties of this plant from the Indians,
and originally wintergreen was the chief source of methyl salicylate.
Aspirin is synthetically the same thing. Birch twigs were later used
as a source and finally it was made from coal tar dye. Like other
volatile oils, methyl salicylate was used as an antiseptic, analgesic,
carminative and flavoring agent. It was added to liniments for rubbing
muscular rheumatism, and similar complaints. Overdoses of
the pure oil on the skin produce drowsiness, congestion and delirium.</p>

<p><b>Cranberry</b> (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccus</i> L.) “mûckiˈ mînagaˈ wûnj”
[swamp berry bush]. A tea for a person who is slightly ill with nausea.
White men have used the bitter, astringent leaves in diarrhea and
diabetes and for purifying the blood.</p>

<p><b>Blueberry</b> (<i>Vaccinium pennsylvanicum</i> Lam.), “minûgaˈ wûnj”
[berry bush]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the leaves of this common
blueberry for a medicinal tea as a blood purifier. White men have
employed it in the same manner.</p>

<h5>EUPHORBIACEAE (SPURGE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Flowering Spurge</b> (<i>Euphorbia corollata</i> L.), “cabosîˈ kûn” [milky
bitter root]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root for a physic. A half
inch of the root is pounded and steeped in a cup of water, which is
drunk before eating. The resinous, milky juice of the root has been
employed by eclectic practitioners as an emetic, but its use has been
practically abandoned because of its irritant and uncertain qualities.</p>

<h5>FAGACEAE (BEECH FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Bur Oak</b> (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> Michx.), “mîtîgoˈ mîc” [wooden
tree], shown in <a href="#plate64">plate 64</a>, fig. 1. The bark is an astringent medicine
to the Pillager Ojibwe. They also use it to bandage a broken foot
or leg. All oaks are noted among the whites for their astringent properties.
Eclectic practitioners used it for gargles in cases of inflammation
of the tonsils and pharynx. It was also used in treating leucorrhea
and piles.</p>

<p><b>Red Oak</b> (<i>Quercus rubra</i> L.), “mîtîgoˈ mîc”, [wooden tree], shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="p370" id="p370">[370]</a></span>
in <a href="#plate64">plate 64</a>, fig. 2. The bark,—“mîtîgoˈ mîc wenaˈ gêk”. The bark is a
medicine for heart troubles and bronchial affections among the Flambeau
Ojibwe. Its use by white men was approximately the same as
Bur Oak.</p>

<h5>FUMARIACEAE (FUMITORY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Golden Corydalis</b> (<i>Corydalis aurea</i> Willd.), “tîpotîeˈ kwason,”
[looks like pants]. The Pillager Ojibwe place the root on coals and inhale
the smoke for clearing the head and reviving the patient. There is
no record of its use by white men.</p>

<h5>FUNGI</h5>

<p>The Ojibwe have evidently had disastrous experiences with mushrooms
in the past and do not use them as a food. The children often
gather the common brackets (<i>Fomes applanatus</i>) and draw pictures
on them, using them as toys.</p>

<p><b>Giant Puffball</b> (<i>Calvatia craniiformis</i> Schw.) shown in <a href="#plate61">plate 61</a>,
fig. 2, “oskweˈtûk”. This is kept on hand in the mature stage. The
inner part has an organized mass of threads and does not break down
entirely into spores as do the smaller puffballs. The substance is
snuffed up the nose to stop nose bleed.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe also made use of an unidentified fungus matte material,
found in the windshake spaces of down timber. This is the matted
vegetating mycelium of some timber fungus, such as <i>Fomes</i>, <i>Trametes</i>,
<i>Polyporus</i> or <i>Pholiota</i>. This made a good tinder for use in the fire
base block, and when the fire stick was rapidly twirled against this
material, it caught fire and was blown into a blaze that became the
basis of their fire. In all medicine lodge ceremonials, the fire was
kindled in this manner and thus deemed a sacred fire. Things cooked
over this fire were ceremonial, and the calumet or pipe used in the
ceremonies was always lighted from a coal of the sacred fire.</p>

<h5>GERANIACEAE (GERANIUM FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Wild Geranium</b> (<i>Geranium maculatum</i> L.), “oˈ sawaskwîniˈ s”
[yellow light].<a name="FNanchor_107_23" id="FNanchor_107_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_23" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the astringent root for
the treatment of flux, and also for healing a sore mouth. Eclectic
practitioners have also used it as a mild internal astringent, useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="p371" id="p371">[371]</a></span>
for infants and people who have a delicate stomach, because it is not
irritating. It is valuable in serious diarrheas. It has also been used
by white men for rectal and vaginal injections to tone up weak
muscles.</p>

<h5>GRAMINEAE (GRASS FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Rattlesnake Grass</b> (<i>Glyceria canadensis</i> [Michx.] Trin.), “anagoneˈ
wûck” [fern]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the roots of this as a
female remedy, but it is difficult to understand why they call it a
fern. There is no record of its use by white men.</p>

<h5>HYDROPHYLLACEAE (WATERLEAF FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Virginia Waterleaf</b> (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i> L.),<a name="FNanchor_108_24" id="FNanchor_108_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_24" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> “neˈ
bîneankweˈ ûk” according to the Pillager Ojibwe White Cloud on
Bear Island, Leech Lake, Minnesota, but “anîmûcîdeˈ bîgons” [dog
feet medicine], according to John Peper, of the same island. It
furnishes a root that may be used to keep flux in check. He states that
it is good for man, woman or child. It was used for the same purpose
among the Meskwaki Indians, but there is no record of its use by
whites.</p>

<h5>IRIDACEAE (IRIS FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Blue Flag</b> (<i>Iris versicolor</i> L.), “naˈ bûkûck”.<a name="FNanchor_109_25" id="FNanchor_109_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_25" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The Flambeau
Ojibwe use a half inch of the root boiled in water as a quick physic. Under
the name “caboˈsîkûn” [milk root], the Pillager Ojibwe use a little
piece of the root in boiling water, drinking a tablespoonful and a half
as an emetic and physic.</p>

<p>Blue Flag root has been accounted one of the most valuable remedies
by the eclectic practitioner. It is alterative, cathartic, sialagogue,
vermifuge and diuretic. It has been used in scrofula and syphilis,
chronic hepatic, renal and splenitic affections.</p>

<h5>LABIATAE (MINT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Wild Mint</b> (<i>Mentha arvensis</i> L. var. <i>canadensis</i> [L.] Briquet),
“nameˈ wûckons” [little sturgeon plant].<a name="FNanchor_110_26" id="FNanchor_110_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_26" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Among the Flambeau
Ojibwe a tea is brewed from the entire plant, to be taken as a blood
remedy. It is also used by them in the sweat bath, “akûskati”. John<span class="pagenum"><a name="p372" id="p372">[372]</a></span>
Peper, Pillager Ojibwe, made an especial trip to find this on the lake
shore but calls it “andegoˈ bîgons” [little crow leaf] and says that they
use it as a tea to break fevers. This species of mint was rarely used by
white men for carminative, stimulant and anodyne affects.</p>

<p><b>Wild Bergamot</b> (<i>Monarda fistulosa</i> L.), “wecaˈ wûs wackwîˈ nek”
[yellow light].<a name="FNanchor_111_27" id="FNanchor_111_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_27" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe gather and dry the whole
plant, boiling it in a vessel to obtain the volatile oil to inhale to cure
catarrh and bronchial affections. In some sections, the whites use
it as a domestic antiperiodic and diaphoretic.</p>

<p><b>Catnip</b> (<i>Nepeta cataria</i> L.) “tciˈ nameˈ wûck” [big sturgeon
plant].<a name="FNanchor_112_28" id="FNanchor_112_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_28" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe brew a tea of catnip leaves for a
blood purifier. The mint water obtained by steeping the herb in
lukewarm water is used to bathe a patient, to raise the body
temperature. The plant is employed by the whites as an emmenagogue
and antispasmodic. It has been used as a carminative to allay
flatulent colic in infants, and is supposed to be useful in allaying hysteria.</p>

<p><b>Heal-all</b> (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i> L.), “basiˈ bûgûk” [partridge leaf].
The root is used by the Flambeau Ojibwe in combination with others
for a female remedy. It has been used by eclectic practitioners as a
pungent and bitter tonic and antispasmodic. It has vermifuge properties
and is slightly diuretic. It has also been used for obstructions
of the liver, cramps and fits.</p>

<p><b>Marsh Skullcap</b> (<i>Scutellaria galericulata</i> L.), “tcatcabonûˈ
ksîk” [refers to the way the stem comes up through the leaves]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe use this for medicine, having something to do with
heart trouble, but we could get no definite information upon it. There
is no record of its use by white men, although a similar species, <i>S.
lateriflora</i> has been used as a nervine, tonic and antispasmodic
in chorea, convulsions, fits, delirium tremens and all nervous affections.</p>

<h5>LEGUMINOSAE (PULSE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Creamy Vetchling</b> (<i>Lathyrus ochroleucus</i> Hook.) “bûgwaˈ dj ûk
pîniˈ k mîneˈ bûg” [unusual potato, berry, leaf]. John Peper, Pillager<span class="pagenum"><a name="p373" id="p373">[373]</a></span>
Ojibwe, said that the foliage was fed to a pony to make him lively
for a race. The Flambeau Ojibwe call it “basiˈ bûgûk” [partridge
leaf], in common with several other plants, and say that the Creamy
Vetch is used for stomach trouble. By the white men, it is considered
one of the loco weeds, bad for horses.</p>

<p><b>Marsh Vetchling</b> (<i>Lathyrus palustris</i> L.), “bebejîgogaˈnji mackiˈ
ki” [horse medicine]. The Pillager Ojibwe feed this to a pony that
is sick and claim it will make him fat. There is no record of its use as
medicine by white men.</p>

<p><b>White Sweet Clover</b> (<i>Melilotus alba</i> Desr.). The Flambeau
Ojibwe claim that this plant is adventive and so they do not use it.
There is no record of its use as medicine by white men.</p>

<h5>LICHENS</h5>

<p><b>Reindeer Moss</b> (<i>Cladonia rangiferina</i> [L.] Hoffm.) “asaˈ gûniñkˈ”
[moss].</p>

<p>The Ojibwe boil this moss and use the water to wash a new born
baby. They declare it is the same as if you were putting salt into the
water. So far as is known, it has never been utilized as a medicine by
the white man.</p>

<h5>LILIACEAE (LILY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Northern Clintonia</b> (<i>Clintonia borealis</i> [Ait.] Raf.), “gînoseˈ
wibûg” [muskellunge leaf].<a name="FNanchor_113_29" id="FNanchor_113_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_29" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root
tea as a remedy to help parturition. John Peper, Pillager Ojibwe
called it “adotaˈgons” [little bell] and said that the dogs use it to
poison their teeth so that they can kill their prey. Should they bite
a person, then it would be necessary to procure the same root and
put it on the bite to draw out the poison. This curious superstition
was also encountered in another tribe,—the Menomini. There is no
record of its medicinal use by white men.</p>

<p><b>Canada Mayflower</b> (<i>Maianthemum canadense</i> Desf.), “agoñgosiˈ
mînûn” [chipmunk berries], shown in <a href="#plate71">plate 71</a>, fig. 1. The
Flambeau Ojibwe recognize that this is somewhat different from
Spikenard (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i>), but give it the same name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p374" id="p374">[374]</a></span>
uses, namely to keep the kidneys open during pregnancy, to cure sore
throat and headaches. It is also used to make smoke for inhaling.
The Pillager Ojibwe do not know or use it.</p>

<p><b>Small Solomon’s Seal</b> (<i>Polygonatum biflorum</i> [Walt.] Ell.)
“nanîbîteˈodeˈkîn”, [grows in a row], shown in <a href="#plate72">plate 72</a>, fig. 2. The
Pillager Ojibwe use the root as a physic and it is also cooked to yield
a tea to treat a cough. White men have used it as a substitute for
<i>Convallaria</i> for the same purposes, namely the treatment of dropsy.</p>

<p><b>False Spikenard</b> (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i> [L.] Desf.), “agoñgoˈ
sîmînûn” [chipmunk berries], shown in <a href="#plate71">plate 71</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use this root in combination with Spreading Dogbane (<i>Apocynum
androsaemifolium</i>) to keep the kidneys open during pregnancy,
to cure sore throat and headache. It is also used as a reviver,
“abaˈbûsûn”. Convallarin is the important constituent of Spikenard
and it is classed the same as Solomon’s Seal and Canada Mayflower.</p>

<p><b>Star-flowered Solomon’s Seal</b> (<i>Smilacina stellata</i> [L.] Desf.)
The Pillager Ojibwe have no name nor use for this root.</p>

<p><b>Carrion-flower</b> (<i>Smilax herbacea</i> L.), “gîneˈ bîgomînagaˈwûnj”
[snake berry bush], shown in <a href="#plate73">plate 73</a>, fig. 2. The root of this plant
was used in lung troubles according to the Pillager Ojibwe. It has
been used by eclectic practitioners as an alterative.</p>

<p><b>Twisted Stalk</b> (<i>Streptopus roseus</i> Michx.), “nanibîteˈ odeˈ kîn”,
[grows in a row], shown in <a href="#plate72">plate 72</a>, fig. 1. This plant is called by the
same name as <i>Polygonatum biflorum</i> among the Pillager Ojibwe, but
this particular one is always referred to as the squaw, while <i>Polygonatum</i>
has always been called the man. It is used for a physic or to
make tea for a cough. There is no record of its medicinal use by
white men.</p>

<p><b>Large Flowered Bellwort</b> (<i>Uvularia grandiflora</i> Sm.), “wesawabiˈ
kwonêk” [yellow light]<a name="FNanchor_114_30" id="FNanchor_114_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_30" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, the name applied to the plant, but
the root is called “wabûckadjiˈ bîk” [white root]. The Pillager Ojibwe
use the root for stomach trouble. The trouble is described as a pain
in the solar plexus, which may mean pleurisy. It has been used by
eclectic practitioners for erysipelas, ulcerated mouth, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p375" id="p375">[375]</a></span></p>

<h5>LYCOPODIACEAE (CLUB MOSS FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Ground Pine</b> (<i>Lycopodium complanatum</i> L.), “gîjiˈk gandoˈ
gûng” [cedar-like]. The dried leaves are used by the Flambeau Ojibwe
as a “nokweˈsîkûn” or reviver. <i>Lycopodium</i> spores are used by the
white man as a surgical dusting powder.</p>

<p><b>Ground Pine</b> (<i>Lycopodium obscurum</i> L. var. dendroideum [Michx.]
D. C. Eaton) “cigonaˈ gan” [evergreen], shown in <a href="#plate61">plate 61</a>, fig. 1.
The Flambeau Ojibwe use this plant in combination with Bush Honeysuckle
roots (<i>Diervilla lonicera</i>) as a diuretic. The spores are the
only part used by the white man for medicine. They are an antiseptic
dusting powder.</p>

<h5>MENISPERMACEAE (MOONSEED FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Canada Moonseed</b> (<i>Menispermum canadense</i> L.), “bîmaˈ kwît
waˈ bîgons” [twisted pod or stick]. White Cloud, Pillager Ojibwe of
Bear Island, did not know the use of this root, but assured the writer
that other Ojibwe knew it and used it. Moonseed root is used by
eclectic practitioners as a tonic and alterative, and has been employed
as a substitute for Sarsaparilla.</p>

<h5>MYRICACEAE (BAYBERRY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Sweet Fern</b> (<i>Myrica asplenifolia</i> L.), “gibaimeˈ nûnaˈgwûs” [coverer].
Sweet fern is called “a coverer,” because it is used to line the
blueberry pails and cover the berries to keep them from spoiling. The
word is almost the same as that used by the Menomini and means
the same. The Flambeau Ojibwe consider the leaves too strong for a
beverage tea, but make a medicinal tea to cure the flux and cramps in
the stomach. The white man uses Sweet Fern as a stimulant and
astringent; sometimes using it to relieve colic and check diarrhea.
It has also been used in a fomentation to relieve rheumatic pains.</p>

<h5>NYCTAGINACEAE (FOUR-O’CLOCK FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Heart-leaved Umbrella-wort</b> (<i>Oxybaphus nyctagineus</i> [Michx.]
Sweet) “gokoˈ coadjiˈ bîk” (pig root). The Pillager Ojibwe say that
the pig is fond of the roots of this plant because they are large and
succulent, hence call it “pig root”. The root is used by them to
reduce sprains and swellings. There is no record of its use among
the whites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p376" id="p376">[376]</a></span></p>

<h5>NYMPHAEACEAE (WATER LILY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Sweet White Water Lily</b> (<i>Castalia odorata</i> [Ait.] Woodville &amp;
Wood.), “odîteˈabûg waˈ bîgwûn” [flat heart leaf, white flower]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe use the root as a cough medicine for those who have
tuberculosis. The roots have been used by white men in the treatment
of diarrhea, dysentery and leucorrhea.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Water Lily</b> (<i>Nymphaea advena</i> Ait.), “ogaˈ da mûn”
[standing on legs]. The Flambeau Ojibwe word is a bit different in
spelling but means the same as the Menomini word for this plant. The
Ojibwe call the leaves, “odîteˈabûg” [flat heart leaf]. The root is the
only medicinal part and is grated to make a poultice for sores. Other
ingredients such as Skunk Cabbage root are added to this poultice.
The Ojibwe gather goodly quantities of the large underwater stems;
which we are prone to call roots, dry them and reduce them to powder.
The powder alone is supposed to heal cuts and swellings. The roots
have been used by white men in the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery
and leucorrhea.</p>

<h5>OLEACEAE (OLIVE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Red Ash</b> (<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i> Marsh), “aˈ gîmaˈk” [snow-shoe
wood]. The Pillager Ojibwe use the inner bark in combination with
other things for a tonic. The inner bark is official with white men as a
bitter tonic and astringent. It is also said to be valuable as an antiperiodic.</p>

<h5>ONAGRACEAE (EVENING PRIMROSE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Great Willow-herb</b> (<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i> L.), “oˈ ca cadjiˈ
bîkes” [slippery or soap root], shown in <a href="#plate69">plate 69</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau
Ojibwe say that the outer rind of this root lathers in water and they
pound it to make a poultice. This is used to draw out inflammation
from a boil or a carbuncle. With white men, it is a demulcent, tonic
and astringent. It has been used internally for its tonic effect on
mucous surfaces and its value in intestinal disorders.</p>

<p><b>Evening Primrose</b> (<i>Oenothera biennis</i> L.) While the Flambeau
Ojibwe have no Indian name for this, still they use the whole plant
soaked in warm water to make a poultice to heal bruises. Because
of its antispasmodic properties, the white man has used it internally
in the treatment of whooping cough, hiccough and spasmodic asthma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p377" id="p377">[377]</a></span></p>

<h5>OPHIOGLOSSACEAE (ADDER’S TONGUE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Virginia Grape Fern</b> (<i>Botrychium virginianum</i> [L.] Sw.), “gîckênsîneˈ
namûkûk” [man, squaw and baby], shown in <a href="#plate66">plate 66</a>, fig. 2.
John Peper, Pillager Ojibwe, hunted a long time for this plant around
Leech Lake, Minnesota, because his mother said it was good for lung
trouble and consumption. He called attention to the fact that one
always finds two stems together in the proper plant to use, which he
described as the man and squaw, with the little one or fruiting frond,
in the center. There is no record of its use by white men.</p>

<h5>ORCHIDACEAE (ORCHIS FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Yellow Ladies’ Slipper</b> (<i>Cypripedium parviflorum</i> Salisb. var.
<i>pubescens</i> [Willd.] Knight), “maˈ kasîn” [moccasin].<a name="FNanchor_115_31" id="FNanchor_115_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_31" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Among the
Pillager Ojibwe, the root of this species is said to be a good remedy for
female troubles of all kinds. The white man has used it as a gentle
tonic for the nerves, a stimulant and antispasmodic, similar to Valerian,
only less powerful.</p>

<p><b>Rein Orchis</b> (<i>Habenaria bracteata</i> [Willd.] R. Br.), “gokoˈcgûnda
mînêskweˈ mîn” [pig-woman enticer root]. The Ojibwe Pillager
would smuggle this into food as an aphrodisiac, which they considered
a bad use and not to be talked about or countenanced. There is no
record of its use by the white men.</p>

<p><b>Adder’s Mouth</b> (<i>Microstylis unifolia</i> [Michx.] BSP.) “aîaˈ
nîkotciˈ mîn” [twisted berry]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the tiny
root of this plant to mix with Bush Honeysuckle bark (<i>Diervilla
lonicera</i>) as a diuretic. There is no record of its use by white men.</p>

<h5>PAPAVERACEAE (POPPY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Bloodroot</b> (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i> L.)<a name="FNanchor_116_32" id="FNanchor_116_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_32" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> “meskwaˈ djiˈ bîkûk”
[red root]. The Pillager Ojibwe use the orange-red juice of the Bloodroot
to cure sore throat. The juice is squeezed out on a lump of maple
sugar, and this is retained in the mouth until it has melted away. They
also use the juice to paint the face for the medicine lodge ceremony
or when on the warpath.</p>

<p><i>Sanguinaria</i> is official only in the U. S. Pharmacopoeia, and in
small doses it produces a sense of warmth in the stomach and stimulates<span class="pagenum"><a name="p378" id="p378">[378]</a></span>
gastric secretion. It is given as an expectorant and in larger
doses as an emetic.</p>

<h5>PINACEAE (PINE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Balsam Fir</b> (<i>Abies balsamea</i> [L.] Mill), “jîngoˈ b” [any kind of fir
tree name], shown in <a href="#plate62">plate 62</a>, fig. 1. While the Flambeau Ojibwe
call the tree “jîngoˈ b” as a short term, the full name of the Balsam
Fir according to them is “jîngoˈ b pîkewaˈ ndag”. They claim that the
liquid balsam is used direct from the bark blister upon the eyes, for
sore eyes. The leaves are a reviver or “abaˈ bûsûn” and are also used
in combinations as a wash. The Pillager Ojibwe call it “jîngoˈ bandag”,
and use the balsam gum for colds and to heal sores. This corresponds
to the way the Hudson Bay Indians use the bark. The
needle-like leaves are placed upon live coals and the smoke is inhaled
for colds. They are also used as a part of the medicine for the
sweat bath.</p>

<p>The sweat bath is taken in a small hemispherical wigwam, like
the regular abode, but entirely covered with mats or nowadays with
canvas. The medicines are coiled into wreaths to fit into large iron
kettles. Water is added and finally hot rocks which cause steam. The
Indian taking the sweat bath may be taking it for ceremonial reasons,
for cleansing, but most likely as a medicated steam bath. He sits
naked within until there is no more steam and his body is entirely
dried again. He then puts on all clean clothes and will not wear the
discarded clothes until they have all been thoroughly washed. The
candidate for degrees in the medicine lodge, must undergo the sweat
bath in a ceremonial way. Usual plants employed to medicate the
steam are White Pine leaves, Hemlock leaves, Arbor Vitae leaves,
Wild Bergamot plant, Balsam needles, Peppermint plants, and the like.
They are undoubtedly very beneficial to the health. Canada balsam
is accounted the same medicinally as turpentine, but its principal
value to the white man today is its perfect transparency and peculiar
optical properties, which fit it for use in mounting microscopic specimens.</p>

<p><b>Tamarack</b> (<i>Larix laricina</i> [Du Roi] Koch), “mûckîgwaˈ tîg”
[swamp tree], shown in <a href="#plate60">plate 60</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the
dried leaves as an inhalant and fumigator, “nokweˈsîkûn”. Larch<span class="pagenum"><a name="p379" id="p379">[379]</a></span>
bark has been highly valued in the past in chronic bronchitis with profuse
expectoration, in chronic inflammation of the urinary passages,
and in phases of hemorrhage.</p>

<p><b>White Spruce</b> (<i>Picea canadensis</i> [Mill.] BSP.), “gawaˈ ndag”,
shown in <a href="#plate62">plate 62</a>, fig. 2. The leaves of White Spruce are used in the
same manner as Larch, as a “nokweˈsîkûn”, an inhalant or fumigator.
The needle oil is considered about the same as turpentine, by white
men.</p>

<p><b>Black Spruce</b> (<i>Picea mariana</i> [Mill.] BSP.), “jingwûp”. If the
bark is meant as a medicinal salt, then its name is “jingwûˈ p gawaˈ
ndag” but if the leaves are the part meant for a reviver, “aba busun”,
then it carries only the name “jingwup”. The needle oil is used by
white men the same as turpentine.</p>

<p><b>Jack Pine</b> (<i>Pinus banksiana</i> Lamb.), “gîgaˈ ndag”. The leaves
are used as a reviver,—“nokweˈ sîkûn” according to the Flambeau
Ojibwe. There is no record of its medicinal use by the white men.</p>

<p><b>Norway Pine</b> (<i>Pinus resinosa</i> Ait.), “abakwanûg iˈmûg” [bark
in plates], shown in <a href="#plate63">plate 63</a>, fig. 2. The Norway Pine is used in all
particulars by the Flambeau Ojibwe, just as the White Pine.</p>

<p><b>White Pine</b> (<i>Pinus strobus</i> L.), “jîngwak kweseskweˈ tûk” according
to Bearskin of the Flambeau Ojibwe, shown in <a href="#plate63">plate 63</a>, fig. 1,
“jîngwak waceskweˈdo” according to Charley Burns of the Flambeau
Ojibwe. The bark medicine is, “jîngwak onaˈ gêk” and is gathered
in the same manner as by the Menomini, with a song to grandmother
Earth, and the placing of tobacco on the ground. The cones, when
boiled and likewise the bark of the young tree trunk yield a
pitch which is medicine, called “jîngwak bûgîo.” The dried leaves
are powdered and used as a reviver or inhalant. There are three names
referring to this sort of treatment, as said before,—“nokweˈ sîkûn”,
“sasaˈ bîkwat” and “abaˈ bûsûn”. Of these three terms, “sasaˈ bîkwat”
is the proper one to use when White Pine needles are employed in this
manner. White Pine is a very valuable remedy with all Ojibwe, but
Norway Pine is sometimes substituted for it. White Pine bark is
used in making cough syrup, by white men, but it possesses only
feeble properties as an expectorant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p380" id="p380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Arbor Vitae</b> (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i> L.), “giˈ jîkandag” [sky or cedar
tree].<a name="FNanchor_117_33" id="FNanchor_117_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_33" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe use the leaves as a perfume, “abaˈ
bûsûn” and also as a tea for headache. During ceremonies of the
medicine lodge, it is necessary to purify sacred objects and the hands
and persons of participants. A plate of live coals is used and dried
Arbor Vitae leaves placed upon them. The servitor wafts the incense
over sacred objects by fanning the smoke with his hands. Others
hold their hands over and in the smoke, waving it upon their persons.</p>

<p>The Pillager Ojibwe call it by the simple name “giˈ jîk” [sky or
cedar]. They also use it as a purifying incense, and as an ingredient
for the sweat bath with White Pine, Balsam, Hemlock and other
plants. They drink the boiled leaves claiming that the steam goes
through the blood and purifies it. This treatment cures coughs.</p>

<p>The U. S. Pharmacopoeia formerly required that leaves for medicinal
use be in a fresh state but the new formulary only requires them
to be recently dried and leafy. Internally it has been used for an
emmenagogue, for fevers, bronchial catarrh, rheumatism and to remove
intestinal worms. Externally it is applied in ointment to treat
ulcers, warts and cancerous growths.</p>

<p><b>Hemlock</b> (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i> [L.] Carr.), “gagagiˈ wîc” [raven
tree]. The Flambeau Ojibwe medicine man puts the leaves in his
medicinal tea to disguise the taste. The bark is used for healing
cuts and wounds, and for stopping the flow of blood from a wound.
The bark is rich in tannin and naturally quite astringent. White men
have used the bark and its resulting pitch as substitutes for burgundy
pitch in making plasters. These have been used as external remedies
for lumbago, chronic rheumatic pains, chronic bronchitis and pleurisy.</p>

<h5>PLANTAGINACEAE (PLANTAIN FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Common Plantain</b> (<i>Plantago major</i> L.), “cecaˈ gûskiˈ bûge
sînk” [leaves grow up and also lie flat on the ground].<a name="FNanchor_118_34" id="FNanchor_118_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_34" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The Flambeau
Ojibwe soak the leaves in warm water then bind them on bruises,
sprains or sores as a poultice. It is also a healing and soothing remedy
for burns, scalds, bee stings, and snake bites. The Flambeau Ojibwe
also refer to it as “pakwan”. The Pillager Ojibwe use it in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="p381" id="p381">[381]</a></span>
manner but call it “jimûckiˈ gobûg” [sort of swamp leaf]. Although
plantain is a feeble remedy, it has been ascribed potency in many
diseases by eclectic practitioners. They still use it to some extent
in treating inflammation of the skin, malignant ulcers, intermittent
fevers, etc. The leaves are of some value in arresting hemorrhages
when applied to the bleeding surfaces. The writer cured a badly
swollen and lacerated hand, which swelled to three times its normal
size, probably because dirt from a sewer was ground into it, with the
simple leaf bound upon the hand.</p>

<h5>POLYGONACEAE (BUCKWHEAT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Carey’s Persicaria</b> (<i>Polygonum careyi</i> Olney). The Ojibwe have
no name or use for this, nor have white men.</p>

<p><b>Swamp Persicaria</b> (<i>Polygonum muhlenbergii</i> [Meisn.] Wats.),
“agoñgoˈ simînûn” [chipmunk berries]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use
this plant for a tea to cure a pain in the stomach. It is also hunting
medicine. Several of the polygonums have been used by eclectic
practitioners for their astringent properties.</p>

<p><b>Curled Dock</b> (<i>Rumex crispus</i> L.) “ciˈobûg” [twisted leaf]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe use the root, which contains considerable tannin,
for closing and healing cuts. White men have used it for its astringent
properties.</p>

<h5>POLYPODIACEAE (FERN FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Shield Fern</b> (<i>Aspidium cristatum</i> [L.] Sw.), “anaˈ ganûck” [fern].
The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root tea for stomach trouble. Among
the white men, this fern has been found to have almost the same value
as Male Fern as a teniafuge. Great care is exercised in the size of the
dose and to see that no part of the drug remains in the system after
it has performed its task of killing intestinal worms, as fatalities have
been known to occur.</p>

<p><b>Female Fern</b> (<i>Asplenium filix-femina</i> [L.] Bernh.), “anaˈ ganûck”
[fern]. The Flambeau Ojibwe grate the dry root into a powder which
is used as a healing powder for sores. The Pillager Ojibwe call it
“nokomiˈ skînûn” [grandmother?]. The root is made into a tea to
cause milk flow in patients with caked breast. There is a record of
its medicinal use by white men to alleviate backache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p382" id="p382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Sensitive Fern</b> (<i>Onoclea sensibilis</i> L.), “aˈ nanaˈ ganûck” [fern].
The Pillager Ojibwe powder the dry root, and make a tea to give the
patient whose breasts are caked, to stimulate the flow of milk. There
is no record of its medicinal use by white men.</p>

<p><b>Brake</b> (<i>Pteris aquilina</i> L.), “anaˈ ganûck” [general fern name].
This is the general name of the bracken fern, where used for food.
When used for medicine, it is called by the Flambeau Ojibwe—“makateˈ
wa anaˈ ganûck” [black fern], and the root is made into tea to
alleviate cramps in the stomach. It is only used by the women for
this purpose. The dried leaves are smoked upon live coals to relieve
a headache. Under the name “aˈ nanaganaˈ wûck” the root is used
by the Pillager Ojibwe in the same manner as by the Flambeau Ojibwe.
White men have considered this root to be pectoral, demulcent, purgative
and anthelmintic. A syrup solution is used in pulmonary and
hepatic diseases. A strong decoction is used to expel worms.</p>

<h5>PRIMULACEAE (PRIMROSE FAMILY)</h5>

<p>So far as is known, none of the Primrose family is used by the
Ojibwe for medicine. The Pillager Ojibwe did not know the Tufted
Loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia thyrsiflora</i> L.).</p>

<h5>RANUNCULACEAE (CROWFOOT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Red Baneberry</b> (<i>Actaea rubra</i> [Ait.] Willd.), “wîckobidjiˈbîk”
[sweet root], shown in <a href="#plate76">plate 76</a>, fig. 1. The Pillager Ojibwe make a
tea from the root, to be drunk by women after childbirth. It is to
clear up the system. A man also eats the root for stomach troubles.
White men use the root as a substitute for Black Cohosh (<i>Cimicifuga
racemosa</i>), which it resembles in appearances and properties. It has
been used in treating ovarian neuralgia, uterine tenderness, subinvolution,
and amenorrhea. It has also been used as a substitute for
digitalis in fatty or irritable heart, but only after other remedies
have failed. Headache due to eyestrain has also been cured by this
root.</p>

<p><b>Canada Anemone</b> (<i>Anemone canadensis</i> L.), “mîdewidjiˈ bîk”
[medicine lodge root], shown in <a href="#plate74">plate 74</a>, fig. 2. The Pillager Ojibwe
eat the root of this plant to clear the throat so they can sing well in
the medicine lodge ceremony,—a sort of throat lozenge. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p383" id="p383">[383]</a></span>
anemones have been substituted for <i>Pulsatilla</i> and used for the same
host of diseases by eclectic practitioners. Included in these ailments
are: cataract, paralysis, rheumatism, melancholia, syphilis, dysmenorrhea,
and many other morbid conditions.</p>

<p><b>Thimble-weed</b> (<i>Anemone cylindrica</i> Gray.), “gande gwaˈ soninkeˈ
cînagwûk” [looks like tumble-weed]. The Flambeau Ojibwe
use the root for making a tea to relieve lung congestion and tuberculosis.
Among the white men it has the same uses as Canada Anemone.</p>

<p><b>Wild Columbine</b> (<i>Aquilegia canadensis</i> L.), shown in <a href="#plate74">plate 74</a>,
fig. 1. The Pillager Ojibwe have no name for this plant, but the root
is considered a good medicine for stomach trouble. Eclectic practitioners
consider it a diuretic, diaphoretic, and antiscorbutic, using
it in jaundice, in smallpox to promote eruption, and in scurvy.</p>

<p><b>Goldthread</b> (<i>Coptis trifolia</i> [L.] Salisb.), “wesa waˈ nikweˈak”
[yellow?] and “wesa wadjiˈbîkweˈak” [yellow root], shown in <a href="#plate75">plate 75</a>,
fig. 1. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the decoction of the root to soothe
and heal the baby’s gums while it is teething. It is also used as a
mouth wash for adults when their mouths are sore. This use has
been adopted by white men, who also use it in dyspepsia and chronic
inflammation of the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Bristly Crowfoot</b> (<i>Ranunculus pennsylvanicus</i> L. f.), “manweˈ
gons”. The seeds are a hunting medicine with the Flambeau Ojibwe.
Several of the <i>Ranunculaceae</i> have been used as counter-irritants by
the white men.</p>

<p><b>Cursed Crowfoot</b> (<i>Ranunculus sceleratus</i> L.). The Pillager Ojibwe
do not know this plant, and have no name for it. Eclectic practitioners
have used it as a counter-irritant.</p>

<p><b>Purple Meadow Rue</b> (<i>Thalictrum dasycarpum</i> Fisch. &amp; Lall.),
shown in <a href="#plate73">plate 73</a>, fig. 1. The Pillager Ojibwe have no Indian name for
this, but use the root to make a tea to reduce fever. The properties
of this root are considered almost identical with <i>Berberis</i>, which is
used by white men as a tonic, stimulant and antiperiodic.</p>

<h5>ROSACEAE (ROSE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Agrimony</b> (<i>Agrimonia gryposepala</i> Wallr.), “sagaˈ tîgans” [seeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="p384" id="p384">[384]</a></span>
stick], shown in <a href="#plate77">plate 77</a>, fig. 1. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root
with other ingredients as a medicine for urinary troubles. It is not
much valued now by white men, although it has been used for its
bitter astringent properties.</p>

<p><b>Smooth Juneberry</b> (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i> Wiegand), “gozigaˈgominagaˈwûnj”
[thorny wood]<a name="FNanchor_119_35" id="FNanchor_119_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_35" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> according to John Whitefeather,
Flambeau Ojibwe, and “bîsegaˈgomînagaˈwûnj” according to Charley
Burns, another Flambeau Ojibwe who said that the bark was used
for medicine, but he did not know what it was to treat. The Pillager
Ojibwe call it “gozigaˈgomînûk” and say that the bark is to make a
tea for the expectant mother. There is no record of its medicinal use
by white men.</p>

<p><b>Hawthorn</b> (<i>Crataegus</i> sp.), “mînesagaˈ wûnj” [berries and thorn
bush], shown in <a href="#plate77">plate 77</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau Ojibwe use both the
fruit and the bark for medicine, a kind not made now, other than for
women. Eclectic practitioners have used the berries for their astringent
and reputed cardiac properties.</p>

<p><b>Wild Strawberry</b> (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i> Duchesne), “odeˈ imînîdjiˈ
bîk,” [heart berry root].<a name="FNanchor_120_36" id="FNanchor_120_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_36" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The root of the common Wild Strawberry
is used to make a tea good for the stomach-ache, and especially
for babies. The white man uses the herb as an astringent and tonic
for convalescents and especially for children having bowel and bladder
weakness.</p>

<p><b>Large-leaved Avens</b> (<i>Geum macrophyllum</i> Willd.), “wicaˈwasaˈ
konek” [yellow light]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use this for a female
remedy. Eclectic practitioners consider the root tonic and astringent.</p>

<p><b>Rough Cinquefoil</b> (<i>Potentilla monspeliensis</i> L.), “tcodeˈ imînagaˈ
wûnj” [like a strawberry]. This plant seemed to be known to all the
Pillager Ojibwe, even the eight-year-old girls, as a physic. There
is no record of its use as a medicine by white men.</p>

<p><b>Marsh Five-finger</b> (<i>Potentilla palustris</i> [L.] Scop.), “bebaˈ akwûndek”
[floats about]. This was dug from the water by John Whitefeather’s
wife, Flambeau Ojibwe, who said it was a cure for cramps<span class="pagenum"><a name="p385" id="p385">[385]</a></span>
in the stomach, and is used alone as one medicine. Under the Pillager
Ojibwe name of “mûckiˈ godjiˈbîk” [swamp root], John Peper
said that it was medicine with them, but he did not know how to use
it. There is no record of its use as medicine by white men.</p>

<p><b>Pin Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus pennsylvanica</i> L. f.), “baeˈwimînûn”. The
inner bark is a valued remedy for coughs. Most of the species of
cherry have been used by white men for the bitter principle contained,
which suits it for use as a stomachic and bitter tonic in gastric atony
and general debility. The syrup of wild cherry has been used as a
pleasant vehicle for other drugs.</p>

<p><b>Wild Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus serotina</i> Ehrh.) “okweˈ mîn” [worm out of
a fly’s egg; refers to the little worms in a cherry when it is ripe].<a name="FNanchor_121_37" id="FNanchor_121_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_37" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The
Flambeau Ojibwe value the bark of this species to make a tea as a
remedy for coughs and colds. It is used the same as Pin Cherry by
white men.</p>

<p><b>Choke Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus virginiana</i> L.), “aˈ sasaweˈ mînagaˈ
wûnj.”<a name="FNanchor_122_38" id="FNanchor_122_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_38" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe make a tea for lung trouble from the
inner bark. This is the official bark in the pharmacopoeia, which is
used as a stomachic and bitter tonic useful in gastric atony and general
debility. Wild cherry syrup is used to mask other unpleasant drugs.</p>

<p><b>Smooth Rose</b> (<i>Rosa blanda</i> Ait.), “ogîneˈ mînagaˈ ons” [rose
berries].<a name="FNanchor_123_39" id="FNanchor_123_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_39" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the skin of the fruit or “rose hip”
for stomach trouble. The Flambeau Ojibwe call it “ogîni” or “ogîniˈ
gawûnj” [rose berries]. They dry and powder the flowers for use in relieving
heartburn. The skin of the rose hips is a medicine for indigestion.
Rose hips are described by white men as refrigerant and astringent,
but are only used in medicine to prepare the confection of hips. Roses
are used almost wholly today to impart their pleasant odor to pharmaceutical
preparations.</p>

<p><b>High Bush Blackberry</b> (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i> Porter), “oˈdatagaˈ
gomîc” [its name].<a name="FNanchor_124_40" id="FNanchor_124_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_40" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe boil the canes to obtain
a tea that is used as a diuretic. The roots furnish a tea for arresting<span class="pagenum"><a name="p386" id="p386">[386]</a></span>
flux. Blackberry and Dewberry root are official in the U. S. Pharmacopoeia
because of their tonic and astringent properties. They are
favorite household remedies among white men in the treatment of summer
diarrhea of children and adults. Blackberry cordial is often used
for the same purpose.</p>

<p><b>Red Raspberry</b> (<i>Rubus idaeus</i> L. <i>aculeatissimus</i> [C. A. Mey]
Regel &amp; Tiling) “meskwaˈ mînagaˈ wûnj” [red bush berry]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe value the berries as a seasoner for their medicines.
That is, the flavor is used to disguise less pleasant ingredients. The
root bark makes a tea for healing sore eyes. Under the name Rubi
Idei Fructus, N. F. white men use the berries for making an agreeable
syrup as a vehicle for less pleasant tasting medicines. When the
Red Raspberry is not readily available the Black Cap Raspberry
is used in the same manner.</p>

<p><b>Meadow-sweet</b> (<i>Spiraea salicifolia</i> L.), “wabûckîkiˈ bug” [rabbit
leaf]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root as a trapping medicine.
There is no record of its use by the white man.</p>

<p><b>Steeple Bush</b> (<i>Spiraea tomentosa</i> L.), “memîsgwûˈnagûg” [squaws’
drink]. The Flambeau Ojibwe make a tea from the leaves and flowers
of the Steeple Bush to drink for the sickness of pregnancy and to act
as an easy parturient. The whites have used the root and the leaves as
an astringent and tonic, in diarrhea, hemorrhages, gonorrhea, ulcers,
etc.</p>

<h5>RUBIACEAE (MADDER FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Goose Grass</b> (<i>Galium aparine</i> L.), “sakateˈ bwi” [stickers].
The whole plant is used by the Pillager Ojibwe to make a tea used for
a diuretic, in kidney trouble, gravel, stoppage of urine, and allied
ailments. Other species are used in much the same way and for the
same purposes. White men have recognized it as a valuable refrigerant
and diuretic, and have found it useful in diseases of the urinary
organs. It is not recommended for diseases of a passive character,
on account of its refrigerant and sedative effects, but is used freely
in fevers and all acute diseases.</p>

<p><b>Small Cleaver</b> (<i>Galium tinctorium</i> L.), “waboskîkiˈ mînûn”
[rabbit swamp berries]. The Flambeau Ojibwe make a medicinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="p387" id="p387">[387]</a></span>
tea from the whole plant, for its beneficial effect upon the respiratory
organs. Eclectic practitioners have used it for its nervine, antispasmodic,
expectorant and diaphoretic properties. It has been successfully
used in asthma, cough, and chronic bronchitis. The plant has a
pungent, aromatic, pleasant, persistent taste.</p>

<p><b>Small Bedstraw</b> (<i>Galium trifidum</i> L.), “ojîbweˈ oweˈ cûwûn”,
[ojibwe male genitalia]. The Pillager Ojibwe make a medicinal tea
of this species for skin diseases such as eczema, ringworm and scrofula.
White men undoubtedly use it in much the same way as the preceding
species through error in identifying it correctly.</p>

<h5>RUTACEAE (RUE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Prickly Ash</b> (<i>Zanthoxylum americanum</i> Mill.), “gawaˈ kumîc”,<a name="FNanchor_125_41" id="FNanchor_125_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_41" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
[its name]. Both Flambeau and Pillager Ojibwe make trips further
south to get this bark, since none of the trees grow near them. They
want it for treating quinsy and sore throat. They say that even the
berries are good for a hot tea to treat sore throat, and also to use as a
spray on the chest to cool and relieve congestion in bronchitis. Among
the white men, it is considered a stimulant, tonic, alterative and
sialagogue and is used for chronic rheumatism, colic, syphilis, and
hepatic derangements.</p>

<h5>SALICACEAE (WILLOW FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Balsam Poplar</b> (<i>Populus balsamifera</i> L.), “manasaˈ di” [perfume
poplar]. The Pillager Ojibwe cook the buds of the Balsam Poplar
in lard or bear fat, and use the cold product for a salve on cuts, wounds
or bruises. They also rub it on the inside of the nostrils, so that the
balsamic odors can course through the respiratory passages and open
them in case of congestion from cold, catarrh or bronchitis. Poplar
buds are also official with white men who use them as a stimulating
expectorant, and in the form of an ointment in treating sluggish ulcers
and sores. Eclectic practitioners have used tinctures of the buds for
stomach and kidney treatment and in scurvy and rheumatism, and
sometimes, apply it to the chest. The bark is used by white men for
a tonic and cathartic, of service in gout and rheumatism.</p>

<p><b>Large-toothed Aspen</b> (<i>Populus grandidentata</i> Michx.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="p388" id="p388">[388]</a></span> “asadi”
[bitter bark]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the young roots of this tree in
a tea as a hemostatic. There is no record of its use by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Quaking Aspen</b> (<i>Populus tremuloides</i> Michx.), “asadi” [poplar].
The Flambeau Ojibwe give this tree the same name as the Large-toothed
Aspen. They use the bark of a young trunk for poulticing cuts and
wounds. The astringent salacin in the inner bark undoubtedly draws
the cuts together and causes healing. The Pillager Ojibwe distinguish
the tree with a slightly different name, “asadins”, the diminutive of
“asadi”, meaning “little poplar”. They use the inner bark for poulticing
a sore arm or leg, and make the inner layer of their splints
of the inner bark so that a broken limb may heal healthily.
Eclectic practitioners use both bark and leaves in treating acute
rheumatism, also to lower the temperature in fevers, to relieve pain
and reduce arterial swellings, colds, hay fever, influenza, neuralgia
and diabetes. Externally the whites have used it as a wash for gangrenous
wounds, eczema, cancer, burns, and body odor.</p>

<p><b>Crack Willow</b> (<i>Salix fragilis</i> L.), “sizigoˈ bimîc” [willow name].
This tree has escaped from cultivation around the water-courses of
the Flambeau Reservation and has been accepted by the Ojibwe there
as efficacious along with the native willows. The bark is astringent
from its salacin content and is used as a styptic and poultice for sores.
Willow bark was formerly employed by physicians among the whites
as a stomachic and antiperiodic in the treatment of intermittents,
but is rarely used today.</p>

<p><b>Shining Willow</b> (<i>Salix lucida</i> Muhl.), “zigoˈ bamîc”. The Pillager
Ojibwe use the bark of this species as an external remedy for
sores. The Ojibwe do not generally distinguish any particular willow
with any other name, but Whitefeather, Flambeau Ojibwe, called this
species “mûckigoˈ bamîc” [swamp tree] and said it was used on a
cut to stop the bleeding, and that the bark was also a poultice material
for sores. Other Flambeau Ojibwe called it “sizigoˈ bamîc”, but it
was generally noticed that in that latitude the Shining Willow was invariably
found in swamps, and not along streams, so there is justification
for Whitefeather’s name. Among the whites, this bark was
used formerly as a stomachic and antiperiodic.</p>

<p><b>Bog Willow</b> (<i>Salix pedicellaris</i> Pursh.), “sizigoˈ bamîc”. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="p389" id="p389">[389]</a></span>
is a species of the cold bogs and meadows found far up toward the
Arctic Circle. While the Pillager Ojibwe did not give it a distinctive
name, they said it was not used for bark to smoke, but for bark to
treat stomach trouble. There is no record of its use by whites.</p>

<h5>SARRACENIACEAE (PITCHER-PLANT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Pitcher-plant</b> (<i>Sarracenia purpurea</i> L.), “oˈ makakiˈ wîdass”
[frog’s leggins], as shown in <a href="#plate67">plate 67</a>, fig. 1. Bearskin, Flambeau
Ojibwe medicine man had a slight variant in pronouncing this—“oˈ
makakiˈ odass”. He said that the root is used to make a tea to
help a woman accomplish parturition. Eclectic practitioners used
the whole plant to make a tea for a tonic, stimulant, diuretic and
laxative.</p>

<h5>SAXIFRAGACEAE (SAXIFRAGE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Wild Red Currant</b> (<i>Ribes triste</i> Pall.), “mîciˈ tcimînûk.” The
Flambeau Ojibwe use the leaves as some sort of a female remedy.
There is no record of its use by the whites.</p>

<h5>SCROPHULARIACEAE (FIGWORT FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Butter and Eggs</b> (<i>Linaria vulgaris</i> Hill.), “owacawaˈ skwûneg”
[yellow light]. The whole plant is dried by the Flambeau Ojibwe and
used in the kettle with other foliage and twigs as a bronchial inhalant
in the sweat lodge. The Ojibwe name for medicine to be inhaled is
“nokweˈsîkûn” which sounds much like the Menomini Indian name
for the same thing,—“naˈ sîkon”. The eclectic practitioners claimed
that the plant is diuretic, and cathartic, using it in dropsy, jaundice,
and cutaneous eruptions. The fresh plant was sometimes used as a
poultice for hemorrhoidal tumors, and an ointment was made of
the fresh flowers for the same purpose and to use locally in diseases
of the skin. In Germany, the flowers were used for a yellow dye.</p>

<p><b>Cow Wheat</b> (<i>Melampyrum lineare</i> Lam.), “agoñgasiˈ mînûk”
[chipmunk berries]. The Flambeau Ojibwe say that this plant is
made into a tea, which is a “little medicine for the eyes”. There is
no record of its medicinal use by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Wood Betony</b> (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i> L.), “mandamîˈ nîodjiˈ
bîkîns” [little corn root]. According to John Peper, Pillager Ojibwe,
this root was a bad kind of medicine, an aphrodisiac, when cut fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="p390" id="p390">[390]</a></span>
and placed in some dish of food without the knowledge of those who
were going to eat it. There is no record of its medicinal use by the
whites.</p>

<p><b>Mullein</b> (<i>Verbascum thapsus</i> L.). The Flambeau Ojibwe have
no name for this since it has come into their territory from the south
and they do not use it. The writer has gathered this for his grandmother
who smoked the leaves for relieving asthma and bronchitis.
The flowers are supposed to have diuretic properties and have been
used in the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>

<h5>THYMELEACEAE (MEZEREUM FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Moosewood</b> (<i>Dirca palustris</i> L.), “djibeˈ gûb” [djibe means a
dead person, or ghost or spirit]. The bark of Moosewood is very soft,
strong and elastic, so that twigs can be tied into knots. The Pillager
Ojibwe say that all their people use it as a tea for a diuretic. The
bark is sometimes substituted for Mezereum bark, which is official in
the U. S. pharmacopoeia. It is usually used in a compound decoction
with sarsaparilla for chronic skin diseases, and syphilitic, rheumatic
and scrofulous conditions. As an external ointment, it was used for a
stimulant to foul or ill-conditioned ulcers.</p>

<h5>TYPHACEAE (CAT-TAIL FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Cat-tail</b> (<i>Typha latifolia</i> L.), “bebamasûˈn” [it flies around]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe used the fuzz of the fruit for a war medicine. They
claim that the fuzz thrown into an enemy’s face will blind him.</p>

<h5>UMBELLIFERAE (PARSLEY FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Musquash Root</b> (<i>Cicuta maculata</i> L.), “apagwasîˈgons”. The
Pillager Ojibwe say that this root is used a little in their medicine,
but did not know just how. It was smoked in hunting.</p>

<p><b>Cow Parsnip</b> (<i>Heracleum lanatum</i> Michx.) “piˈ pîgweˈ wanûck”
[flute stem].<a name="FNanchor_126_42" id="FNanchor_126_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_42" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe pound the fresh root and apply
it as a poultice to cure sores. The fresh leaves and root are known to
produce vesication or blisters by the whites, and therefore have been
used by them as counter-irritants. The root has been used by eclectic
practitioners to cure epilepsy. In infusions, it is thought to cure
dyspeptic disorders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p391" id="p391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Sweet Cicely</b> (<i>Osmorhiza longistylis</i> [Torr.] D. C.), “osagaˈ tîkûm”
[interlaced twigs]. The same name was applied by the Pillager Ojibwe
to <i>O. claytoni</i>, and evidently they did not distinguish between the
two species. A tea for making parturition easier is prepared from the
roots. The liquorice flavor of the tea is said to be good for a sore
throat.</p>

<p><b>Wild Parsnip</b> (<i>Pastinaca sativa</i> L.), “pigweˈwûnûsk” [flute stem].
The Pillager Ojibwe are quite cautious in using this poisonous root.
They claim that a little bit is very powerful, while much is poisonous.
They use a very minute quantity mixed with four other kinds of
roots to make a medicinal tea for female troubles. There is no record
of its medicinal use by the whites.</p>

<p><b>Black Snakeroot</b> (<i>Sanicula marilandica</i> L.), “masan” [from the
woods]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root pounded as a poultice
to cure rattlesnake bite or any snake bite. Bearskin, chief Flambeau
medicine man said that if this root be chewed, it would cause eruptions
on the epithelial lining of the mouth. They consider it a very
potent remedy. The Pillager Ojibwe call it “gîneˈbîg odjiˈ bîk”
[snake root] and make a root tea that is used to cure fevers of various
kinds. Eclectic practitioners have accredited it with active aromatic,
bitter principles. They have used it in intermittent fevers, sore throat,
erysipelas and cutaneous affections. It has been also used for St.
Vitus dance and other nervous affections.</p>

<h5>URTICACEAE (NETTLE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Hop</b> (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), “jiwîˈcgoniˈbûg”. The Pillager Ojibwe
use the common hop to make a tea which acts like saleratus on
the system, increasing the excresence of urine and reducing its acidity.
It is official in the U. S. pharmacopoeia as a tonic, diuretic, sedative
and somewhat anaphrodisiac.</p>

<p><b>Wood Nettle</b> (<i>Laportea canadensis</i> [L.] Gaud.), “masaˈnatîk”
[forest wood]. The Pillager Ojibwe use the root to make a medicinal
tea for its diuretic properties. It is said to cure various urinary ailments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p392" id="p392">[392]</a></span>
Eclectic practitioners have considered it tonic, astringent
and diuretic. They use both roots and leaves. The seeds and flowers
are given in wine for the ague.</p>

<p><b>Slippery Elm</b> (<i>Ulmus fulva</i> Michx.), “anib”. The Pillager Ojibwe
use the slippery inner bark for sore throat, especially when the
throat is apt to be dry. Slippery Elm is official in the U. S. pharmacopoeia
as a demulcent, emollient and nutritive. It is considered
useful internally for dysentery, diarrhea and bronchitis. Pounded
bark for poultices has been used for boils and inflammations, and in
compounding suppositories.</p>

<p><b>Lyall’s Nettle</b> (<i>Urtica lyallii</i> Wats.), “masan” [woods]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe use only the leaves as medicine. These are soaked
in warm water and used as a poultice for heat rashes. It is something
like fighting fire with fire. Among the whites, nettles are known for
their powerful and peculiar diuretic properties.</p>

<h5>VIOLACEAE (VIOLET FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>Canada Violet</b> (<i>Viola canadensis</i> L.) Although a common
violet in the territory of the Pillager Ojibwe, they claimed to have no
name or use for it. It was formerly used by eclectic practitioners as a
blood purifier and as a remedy in chronic affections of the lungs, and
in skin diseases, but is no longer used.</p>

<p><b>American Dog Violet</b> (<i>Viola conspersa</i> Reichenb.), “wewaîeˈ
bûgûg”. The whole plant is used by the Flambeau Ojibwe to make
a tea for heart trouble. The whole plants have been used among the
whites as alterative and expectorant remedies. They were said to be
useful in skin diseases, scrofula, syphilis and bronchitis.</p>

<h5>VITACEAE (VINE FAMILY)</h5>

<p><b>River-bank Grape</b> (<i>Vitis vulpina</i> L.), “ciˈwî mînûn” or “ciwî
mînaga wûnj”, shown in <a href="#plate70">plate 70</a>, fig. 2. The Pillager Ojibwe used a
tea of boiled twigs for women to drink to clear up afterbirth and enable
it to pass easily. They use the sap as a medicine for stomach and
bowel trouble. Among the whites, the tender branchlets and leaves
were sometimes employed for their agreeable acidulous flavor.</p>

<h2><a name="VEGETAL_FOODS" id="VEGETAL_FOODS"></a>OJIBWE VEGETAL FOODS</h2>

<p>The Ojibwe have always lived far from the haunts of civilization.
They were too far in the back country to participate in the colonial and
pre-colonial wars. They have always preferred to live where game
is abundant, and even today they are still able to subsist partly on
deer and fish. The products of the hunt were very important to them,
and they possess a very large number of hunting charms, which are
roots, seeds or blossoms that are used as good luck omens or actual
lures in trapping and fishing.</p>

<p>They have always made the greatest use of the edible plants
of their environment, but did not progress very far in an agricultural
way until the last quarter century, when each reservation was furnished
with an Indian or white farmer, preferably an Indian. He has used
the school children to cultivate demonstration farms, and his example
is persisting in some of his former pupils. The older people had a few
simple products from prehistoric days and have not allowed them to
completely run out. The garden patch was always small, and the
caretaker was invariably the woman of the household. Among the
cultivated crops were: Cranberry pole beans, maize or Indian corn,
potatoes of an early variety, squash and tobacco. The last crop has
not been grown by them in fifty years, as they now depend upon the
white men for their source of supply. At the present time, they raise
any of the crops, that the white men raise. In their gardens, one will
find lettuce and onions, radishes, carrots, parsnips, beets, turnips,
cabbage, potatoes of standard varieties, beans and peas, and any other
crop one will find in an up-to-date garden. Stranger still, one may
find garden flowers, and the lady of the house will be quite proud of
them, and usually a little jealous, if her neighbor has some flowers
that she has not.</p>

<p>Some of the wild crops they gather possess considerable commercial
value, such as blueberries and wild rice. The laborious work of preparing
wild rice for table use has boosted the price to $1.05 a pound,
which those “in the know” gladly pay. Blueberries yield a goodly
part of their cash income, for the berries usually sell for about twenty
cents a quart, and it is easy for an Indian family to pick eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="p394" id="p394">[394]</a></span>
quarts in a day. They do not pick them like the white man does, but
comb the bushes with their fingers, removing the leaves and twigs
later.</p>

<p>The Ojibwe are fond of their native foods, and since they regard
all plants as the gift of their deities, and sacred to their uses, they feel
that their native foods are medicine to keep them in health as well
as foods. While they know nothing about vitamins or chemical
constituents, they think that there are some salts or minerals in their
native foods that keep them well. We know that they are correct
in that. They ascribe many of their present diseases to the
abandonment of their native foods and the adoption of white men’s
foods. They think that the early failure of their teeth is due to using
too much white flour for bread.</p>

<p>From the middle of July to the middle of September, one will
find the women busily caring for the various food harvests. Maize
will be drying on cloth screens, and blueberries will be drying to
tough, inky pellets. Raspberries and dewberries are cooked into
jams, cranberries are cooked with maple sugar into a jelly, and circles
of squash are strung on a basswood bark string. Men and women
are busy at the shallow lake harvesting wild rice, and all are very
active. Sundays they will stop for a pow-wow or dream dance, but
not if it is the wild rice harvest time. The food plants are listed
alphabetically by families.</p>

<h3><a name="FOOD_PLANTS" id="FOOD_PLANTS"></a>OJIBWE FOOD PLANTS</h3>

<h4>ACERACEAE (MAPLE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Box Elder</b> (<i>Acer negundo</i> L.), “adjagobiˈ mûk”. The Pillager
Ojibwe collect the sap of the Box Elder and mix it with the sap of the
regular Sugar Maple to drink as a beverage.</p>

<p><b>Sugar Maple</b> (<i>Acer saccharum</i> Marsh.), “înenaˈ tîg” [Indian
tree] and “adjagobiˈ mîn”. Both names came from the Pillager
Ojibwe,<a name="FNanchor_127_43" id="FNanchor_127_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_43" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and although the trees were scarce on the Flambeau Reservation,
they also call it “înenaˈ tîg”, and gather quantities of the sap
somewhere south of the reservation. Maple sugar is one of their most<span class="pagenum"><a name="p395" id="p395">[395]</a></span>
important foods and is used in almost every kind of cookery. Maple
sap is saved to drink as it comes from the tree, sometimes with the
added sap of the Box Elder or Yellow Birch. Again it is allowed to
become sour to make a vinegar “cîwaˈbo” used in their cookery of
venison, which, when afterwards sweetened with maple sugar, corresponds
to the German fashion of sweet-sour meat. Before they
had the salt of the white man, maple sugar took its place and still
does when they can get it. All kinds of meats were seasoned with it.
There are many interesting legends about the tree, its discovery
and sugar making, as related in Mr. Alanson Skinner’s “Material
Culture of the Menomini”.<a name="FNanchor_128_44" id="FNanchor_128_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_44" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The Ojibwe garner their sugar crop
much the same way as they did years ago, except that they have
used large iron kettles since the coming of the white man. The sugar
camps are rather permanent affairs, and the framework of the boiling
house with its upright poles around the fire place to hold the kettles
is left intact. A bark-covered wigwam is used to store the tools of
sugar sap gathering, and granulation. Most of the sap vessels and
storage vessels are made of birch bark, sewed with boiled basswood
fiber or the core of the Jack Pine root. The vessels are rendered waterproof
by the application of pitch secured by boiling Jack Pine cones.</p>

<p>In early April, the Ojibwe visit their camps, the men to repair the
camps and the storage vats of hollowed logs, and to cut fire wood, the
women to see that the sap buckets and mokoks are scrupulously
clean and watertight. If some can not be repaired, rolls of birchbark
are there to make new ones. The whole family then move to the
camp and live in the large wigwam, while they make sugar for a month.
During the sap flow, a man can chop holes and set taps into from two
to three hundred trees in a day. The first flow of sap is the best, and
it gets to be of a rather poor quality by the end of the flow. The
Ojibwe will not use the night flow of the sap, which they say is bitter, so
they cease collecting an hour before dark. Gathered sap is stored in
hollowed basswood log vats, and covered over with birch bark to
keep it clean. Boiling in the iron kettles is done much as the white
man does it, except that foam is dissipated by stirring with a fresh
brush of a spruce branch. The syrup is strained through a cloth and
recooked in two or three quart quantities until it is ready to sugar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p396" id="p396">[396]</a></span>
Then, while still warm, it is poured into a wooden trough, where it is
pounded and crushed with a heavy wooden paddle as it hardens. It
is stored in covered birch bark baskets called mokoks, of from twenty-five
to seventy-five pounds capacity. The sugar is graded according
to its whiteness and stored away. Sap is often added to the dregs in the
kettles and a second grade sugar is secured. To waste or spill any of
the sap is considered an affront to their deities, who punish such an
act by causing the sugar to shrink after it is made.</p>

<h4>ALISMACEAE (WATER-PLANTAIN FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Arum-leaved Arrowhead</b> (<i>Sagittaria arifolia</i> Nutt.) “wabasiˈ
pîn” [white potato].<a name="FNanchor_129_45" id="FNanchor_129_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_45" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Both the Flambeau and the Pillager Ojibwe
call this by the same name and use it exactly alike as far as its food
value is concerned. The Pillager Ojibwe also use it as a medicine for
man and horse. The Flambeau Ojibwe recognize that it is also a
favorite food of ducks and geese. A similar species found in California
is used by the Indians there as a potato under the name “wappate”
or “wapatoo”, and is called by the whites there “Tule root.”<a name="FNanchor_130_46" id="FNanchor_130_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_46" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
The corms are a most valued food source to the Ojibwe. They will dig
them if they cannot get them more easily. Muskrat and beavers store
them in large caches, which the Indians have learned to recognize and
appropriate. It is difficult to dig them out still attached to the plant,
because the connection between the roots and the corm is so fragile
and small. The round corms are attached by a tiny rootlet to the
main mass of fibrous roots, and are capable of reproducing the plant
in a vegetative manner, just as the Irish Potato does. They are from
one-half to an inch and a half in diameter and about three-quarters to
two inches long. They are pure white inside, sweet and quite starchy.
The Indian does not differentiate between this species and the Broad-leaved
Arrowhead. For winter use, the potato is boiled, then sliced
and strung on a piece of basswood bark fiber and hung up overhead
for storage. They also use the fresh corms, cooking them with deer
meat, and maple sugar. Some of the potatoes are kept over after
cooking and the maple sugar is thickened until they might almost be
called candied sweet potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p397" id="p397">[397]</a></span></p>

<h4>ANACARDIACEAE (SUMAC FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Smooth Sumac</b> (<i>Rhus glabra</i> L.), “bakwaˈ nak” [binding tree].
The Flambeau Ojibwe gather the berries to make a pleasant beverage
much like lemonade. The berries are tart and are sweetened with
maple sugar, soaked in water until required for use. They also gather
and dry them for winter use. The dried berries are cooked in water
with maple sugar, and form a hot drink, instead of a cooling one,
as used in the summer and fall.</p>

<p><b>Staghorn Sumac</b> (<i>Rhus typhina</i> L.), “bakwaˈ natîg” [binding
tree].<a name="FNanchor_131_47" id="FNanchor_131_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_47" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the berries in the same way as the
Flambeau Ojibwe use this species, and under the same name. They
also store up the dried seed heads for winter use.</p>

<h4>ARISTOLOCHIACEAE (BIRTHWORT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Wild Ginger</b> (<i>Asarum canadense</i> L. var. <i>acuminatum</i> Ashe), “nameˈ
pîn”, [sturgeon potato].<a name="FNanchor_132_48" id="FNanchor_132_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_48" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe often use this root in
cookery to season the food. They claim it takes away any muddy
taste from fish, and will render any meat dish digestible by anyone,
even if they are sick. The roots are processed in lye water for cookery
on a large scale.</p>

<h4>ASCLEPIADACEAE (MILKWEED FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Common Milkweed</b> (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i> L.), “caboˈ sîkûn” [milk],
“înîniwûnj” [indian plant] Flambeau name.<a name="FNanchor_133_49" id="FNanchor_133_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_49" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe
eat the fresh flowers and tips of the shoots in soups. They are
usually cooked with some kind of meat and become somewhat mucilaginous
like okra, when cooked. They also gather and dry the flowers
for refreshening in the winter time, to make into soup.</p>

<h4>BETULACEAE (BIRCH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Yellow Birch</b> (<i>Betula lutea</i> Michx. f.), “wiˈnîsîk”. The Flambeau
and Couderay Ojibwe tap the Yellow Birch for sap to add to maple
sap for a pleasant beverage drink.</p>

<p><b>Hazelnut</b> (<i>Corylus americana</i> Walt.), “mûkwobagaˈ nak” [bear
nut].<a name="FNanchor_134_50" id="FNanchor_134_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_50" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The Flambeau Indians use the hazel nut as a food and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="p398" id="p398">[398]</a></span>
especially fond of the newly gathered nuts before the kernel has hardened.
The name is often shortened to “bagaˈ nak”.</p>

<p><b>Beaked Hazelnut</b> (<i>Corylus rostrata</i> Ait.), “baˈ ganaˈ mîc” [nut
tree]. The Pillager Ojibwe also use the Beaked Hazelnut. The Flambeau
Ojibwe also recognize it as “bagaˈ nak” [nut] and use it as a
food.</p>

<h4>CAPRIFOLIACEAE (HONEYSUCKLE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Nannyberry</b> (<i>Viburnum lentago</i> L.), “atîteˈ tamîn”.<a name="FNanchor_135_51" id="FNanchor_135_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_51" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The
berries are eaten when ripe, fresh from the bush, and are also used
in jam with wild grapes.</p>

<h4>CELASTRACEAE (STAFF TREE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Climbing Bittersweet</b> (<i>Celastrus scandens</i> L.), “manîdobîmaˈ
kwît” [spirit twisted].<a name="FNanchor_136_52" id="FNanchor_136_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_52" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe story of this plant
is practically the same as that of the Menomini, as given in
Museum bulletin Vol. IV, No. 1, pp. 63-64. Bittersweet is
fairly abundant around Leech Lake, and is found in dense
hardwood forests climbing to tops of trees thirty feet or more
in height. When food is unobtainable in the winter, because
the snow is too deep and game is scarce, the Ojibwe gather this bark
and separate the inner bark to make a thick soup for a meal. While
it is not so very palatable, it is sustaining and they may subsist on it
for a considerable time, until they are able to get some game, or to
go to some relatives and get other foodstuffs. The Ojibwe name refers
as does the Menomini name, to the twisted intestines of their cultural
hero, Winabojo.</p>

<h4>COMPOSITAE (COMPOSITE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Large-leaved Aster</b> (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i> L.), “mêgêsiˈ bûg”,
[eagle leaf]. The leaves of this aster are eaten when young and tender.
The Flambeau Ojibwe declare that they are fine-flavored and good
to eat, because they act as medicine at the same time that they are
food. Among the Pillager Ojibwe they use the root of this same aster
as a soup material, but call it “nêmêgosiˈ bûg” [trout leaf].</p>

<p><b>Philadelphia Fleabane</b> (<i>Erigeron philadelphicus</i> L.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="p399" id="p399">[399]</a></span> “micao
gacan” [odor of split hoof of doe]. The Pillager Ojibwe say that
deer and cows eat this plant and that they use it in their smoking
tobacco or kinnikinnik mixture.</p>

<p><b>Dandelion</b> (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i> Weber) “wecaˈ waskwûneˈ k”
[yellow light]. The Flambeau Ojibwe gather the young leaves in the
spring and cook them with pork or venison for greens, using vinegar
made from soured maple sap.</p>

<h4>CORNACEAE (DOGWOOD FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Panicled Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus paniculata</i> L’Her.) “meskwabiˈ
mîc” [red bush]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use this bark in their kinnikinnik
or native smoking tobacco. Sometimes real tobacco is
mixed with it and sometimes not, as real tobacco is expensive. The
twig bark is peeled and toasted over coals on a crude drying fork, then
further shredded to carry in their tobacco pouches and smoke in
their pipes.</p>

<h4>CRUCIFERAE (MUSTARD FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Large Toothwort</b> (<i>Dentaria maxima</i> Nutt.), “mûkwopîniˈk”
[bear potato]. The rootstocks of this cress are very abundant in wet,
springy ground in the forest. The white man can only identify this
plant in the spring of the year when the flower and leaf are found, but
the Ojibwe knows the root and where it grows so gathers it when it
has matured. It is a favored wild potato, but has a very pungent
acrid taste when freshly dug. They heap the mass of cleaned roots
upon a blanket and cover it closely to exclude the air for four or five
days. During this time the roots ferment and lose the acrid taste,
becoming sweet and palatable. The Ojibwe cook them with corn and
deer meat, or with beans and deer meat, and say that, besides being
a fine food, they are a good medicine for the stomach.</p>

<h4>CUCURBITACEAE (GOURD FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Cucumber</b> (<i>Cucumis sativus</i> L.), “eckaˈdamîn” [its name]. The
Ojibwe use their cucumbers raw, but sometimes flavor them with a
vinegar “cîwaˈbo” made from souring maple sap. They are further
flavored with powdered maple sugar.</p>

<p><b>Ojibwe Squash</b> (<i>Cucurbita maxima</i> Duchesne), “ogwîˈssi maun
owaso kwoneˈk” [pumpkin, yellow light]. Their word<span class="pagenum"><a name="p400" id="p400">[400]</a></span> “ogwissimaun”
literally means “tangled hairs”, and refers to the strings inside upon
which the seeds are borne. The Flambeau Ojibwe cultivate their
own variety of squash, although they say that they got it originally
from the Iroquois. They dry rings of squash for winter use.</p>

<p><b>Large Pie Pumpkin</b> (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i> L.), “missaˈ bîgon” [little
giant plant]. They have cultivated this original Ojibwe dark yellow
pie pumpkin since long before the advent of the white man. They cut
it into rings and sun dry it for winter use.</p>

<p><b>Gourds</b> (<i>Lagenaria vulgaris</i> Ser.), “jicaˈwîgan” [hollow like]. The
Ojibwe cultivate the gourds, which they eat when young, before the
rind has hardened. They also make use of them for drinking and
dipping cups, and for rattles in the medicine lodge. The medicine
man, “mîdewag”, keeps the rhythm of his songs by shaking them.
They are pierced, kernels of corn or shells inserted, and then corked
again for use.</p>

<h4>EQUISETACEAE (HORSETAIL FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Field Horsetail</b> (<i>Equisetum arvense</i> L.), “gîjiˈ bînûsk” [duck
food].<a name="FNanchor_137_53" id="FNanchor_137_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_53" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe gather this for their domesticated ducks
to eat and also to feed their ponies, to make their coats glossy.</p>

<h4>ERICACEAE (HEATH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Bog Rosemary</b> (<i>Andromeda glaucophylla</i> Link.), “bîneˈ mîkci”
[swamp]. Young, tender leaves and tips of this plant are used by the
Flambeau Ojibwe to boil for a beverage tea. While they often pick
and use it fresh on the hunting trail, they also gather and dry it for
later use. It is not a bad substitute for “store tea.”</p>

<p><b>Leather Leaf</b> (<i>Chamaedaphne calyculata</i> [L.] Moench.), “wabackîkiˈ
bûg” [rabbit leaf]. This is another beverage tea leaf, prized
by the Flambeau Ojibwe. It is used on the trail or dried and saved
for future use. The Pillager Ojibwe also use it in the same manner,
under the name,—“mackiˈ gobûgons” [little swamp leaf].</p>

<p><b>Wintergreen</b> (<i>Gaultheria procumbens</i> L.), “wînîsiˈ bûgûd” [dirty
leaf], shown in <a href="#plate75">plate 75</a>, fig. 2. While the Flambeau Ojibwe use this
as a rheumatic medicine, they also use the leaf tea from the youngest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p401" id="p401">[401]</a></span>
tenderest leaves as a beverage tea, and especially favor it because it
“makes them feel good”. They also eat the wintergreen berry which
they call “owînîsiˈ mîn”.</p>

<p><b>Labrador Tea</b> (<i>Ledum groenlandicum</i> Oeder.), “waboskîkiˈ bûg”
[rabbit leaf], shown in <a href="#plate76">plate 76</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the
tender leaves of this plant for a beverage tea, and will even eat the
leaves in the tea. It is a well known tea to many northern and Canadian
Indians.</p>

<p><b>Cranberry</b> (<i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> L.), “mûckiˈ mîn” [swamp berry]
shown in <a href="#plate67">plate 67</a>, fig. 2. This is an important wild food of the Flambeau
Indians and also of the Pillager Ojibwe, who use a slightly different
pronunciation, “mûckîtciˈ mîn” [swamp berry]. The train men that
go through that reservation never seem to tire of getting Johnnie Frog
to say “cranberry pie” for them in Ojibwe. It sounds so complicated
because they really have no word for pie in their language but must
say, “swamp berries made into sauce rolled between bread”,—“mûckiˈ
gimînûn backiˈ mînasîgûn wiwegidaˈsîgûn”.</p>

<p><b>Blueberry</b> (<i>Vaccinium pennsylvanicum</i> Lam.), “mînûn” [berries].
The Flambeau and the Pillager Ojibwe harvest quantities of
blueberries both for themselves and to sell. They dry them in large
quantities on raised scaffolds of rush mats, like currants, or raisins,
which they somewhat resemble. In the winter, they like to cook them
with dried sweet corn, sweetened with maple sugar. They also cook
them with wild rice, and venison and make a sweet bread with
them. They have different names for different varieties of blueberries.
The Low Blueberry (<i>V. vacillans</i> Kalm.) is called “gimîneˈsît” while the
low Black Blueberry (<i>V. nigrum</i> [Wood] Britton) is called “makateˈ
mîn” [black blueberry]. No specimens of the last two were secured,
but the names were common among the Ojibwe.</p>

<h4>FAGACEAE (BEECH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Beech</b> (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i> Ehrh.) “gaweˈmîc”. All the Ojibwe
know and appreciate the sweet nuts of the beech tree. They are
never plentiful enough to store for winter, but the Indians like them
fresh.</p>

<p><b>White Oak</b> (<i>Quercus alba</i> L.), “mîciˈ mîn” [oak berry]. All Ojibwe<span class="pagenum"><a name="p402" id="p402">[402]</a></span>
encountered told of their former dependence upon acorns for
their soup stock. It seems that at least every Algonkian tribe knew
and used all species of acorns. They got rid of the bitter tannin taste
by soaking the acorns in hot lye. Wood ashes in water, when boiled
gave them the lye. A regular woven bark bag held a quantity of
acorns and the lye was leached out by washing the whole bagful in
several changes of warm water. The acorns were then dried for storage,
and when wanted, pounded and ground to a coarse flour which was
used to thicken soups or form a sort of mush. Blueberries were often
cooked with this mush to give it a good flavor and it was seasoned
with maple sugar. White Oak acorns needed no lye treatment.</p>

<p><b>Bur Oak</b> (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> Michx.), “mîtîgoˈ mîc” [wooden
tree]. Bur Oak acorns are bitter, but yield to the lye treatment to
become as edible as the acorns of the White Oak.</p>

<p><b>Red Oak</b> (<i>Quercus rubra</i> L.), “mîtîgoˈ mîc” [wooden tree]. Because
Red Oak was so abundant in the Ojibwe territory and so large
in size, the acorns were one of their most important starchy foods.
They leached the tannic acid flavor with lye and brought them to a
par with the sweet acorns of White Oak.</p>

<p><b>Black Oak</b> (<i>Quercus velutina</i> Lam.) “têˈ komîn”. The name is
evidently an abbreviation of “mêtîgoˈ mîn”, but probably an intentional
one for this tree was always referred to by the abbreviation.
Its acorns were equally good as others when the tannin was extracted.</p>

<h4>FUNGI</h4>

<p>The writer found that none of the Ojibwe eat any of the mushrooms
although they have two names for them,—“pîkwaˈ djîc” and
“wajackweˈ do” [muskrat]. Probably some remote ancestor had a
fatal experience with mushrooms and the news has been handed
down. Although the Ojibwe have fanciful stories explaining why they
use certain plants, no doubt their knowledge came by a process of
trial and error through the centuries and the errors have been duly
buried but not entirely forgotten.</p>

<h4>GRAMINAE (GRASS FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Corn</b> (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), “mandaˈ mîn”. Corn is a traditional heritage
of the Ojibwe, although none knew a time when they did not have it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p403" id="p403">[403]</a></span>
Their origin myth is that it was a pinch of flesh taken from the side
of their culture hero, Winabojo, by himself and cast upon the ground,
to grow and become corn for them. This is the same as acknowledging
that they do not know how it came to be here. When mandamin
matures, they say that only horses can eat it raw in that condition.
They have to soak it in lye water, wash out the lye and then
parboil it to prepare it for the table. This is the same as our hominy.
Scientists think now that corn originated in Mexico from an accidental
crossing of teosinte and gama grass. While the Ojibwe cultivate and
grow the approved strains of corn for Wisconsin, they also cling to
their own “calico” corn, with all sorts of colors of grains on different
cobs. They have two names for sweet corn,—“wîckobiˈ mandaˈmîn”
[sweet maize], and “wîckobiˈ sîˈganûg” [turns sweet in cooking]. Their
sweet or soft corns are different from those used by the white man.
They roast the ears in the husk and make it into hominy as the white
man does. They cut the kernels from their sweet corn and dry them
for winter use. It is also boiled in a kettle, and when half-cooked,
is cut from the cob and dried for winter use.</p>

<p>They had a name for popcorn, but the writer saw none of it while
around them.</p>

<p><b>Wild Rice</b> (<i>Zizania palustris</i> L.), “manoˈ mîn” [good berry].
The Ojibwe word is their pronunciation of the Menomini term for
wild rice. Most Algonkians have the same word for wild rice and it
forms a very important part of their food. The writer has often
been present at the Ojibwe rice harvests. The largest operation seen
was that of the Ojibwe at Mole Lake in Forest County, Wisconsin.
There about twenty families were working at one time and the writer
worked at each operation to become familiar with it. Wild rice preparation
is the hardest kind of labor, and they earn all they get for it
when they sell it. It sells in Milwaukee for $1.05 a pound, but one
can buy it from the Indians at $.25 to $.35 a pound. One man reaped
1325 pounds of rice in the harvest time. The Menomini Rice Harvest
group in the Public Museum exhibition halls, shows very well most
features of the operation.</p>

<p>Various families have definite parts of the lake for their share,
while others travel to small lakes and stay there until the harvest
is complete. They set up a family camp, while the grain is still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p404" id="p404">[404]</a></span>
the milk stage and wait for it to ripen. When this time arrives, having
made experimental collections to determine it, they make a ceremonial
gathering. Three to a canoe, two women and a man go to
the rice beds and gather sufficient rice for a preliminary feast. With
a hooked stick, held in a crescent by a string, the women pull the rice
over the canoe and beat off the kernels with a stick, into the canoe
bed. Sometimes, when the Indians do not want to waste any of the
rice, they will go into the beds before it is ripe and tie several heads
together to ripen in that manner. The first collection is prepared
complete, with songs to their deities and a ceremonial feast is observed.
After that all hands fall to in earnest and gather unremittingly until
all the rice is harvested.</p>

<p>When the canoe is partly loaded, they pole back to camp, to prepare
it. Wild rice grows in a mucky soil which may be quite deep.
Ten foot poles, with a wide fork to secure a hold on the grass, are used
to propel the canoe through the rice. On the return trip when loaded,
the women trample the rice to break off the spiny beards or awns. The
next step is roasting or parching. A wash tub is tilted against a large
back log and a fire maintained under it. To keep the rice from burning,
one must use a forty inch paddle and stir constantly for about three
hours. The roasting destroys any weevils that might be present,
gives the rice a pleasant flavor, loosens the husks or glumes and hardens
the rice so it may be kept indefinitely.</p>

<p>In earlier times, a hole was dug into the ground and carefully
lined with buckskin. Nowadays a candy bucket is sunk into the hole.
This is the threshing floor. A man with new moccasins steps in to
trample and thresh it.<a name="FNanchor_138_54" id="FNanchor_138_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_54" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> He has a couple of poles, slanting near the
hole, and supported on a tree with which he balances, while trampling
the rice. He gives a circular, twisting pressure to the rice with his
feet to grind off the husks. Then the chaff is winnowed away by a
woman as shown in the present series, Vol. IV, plate 29, fig. 2. A large
shallow birchbark tray is shaken up and down by the woman as she
stands in a breeze. If there is no wind, the chaff accumulates
on top and is pushed over the edge from time to time. After the
winnowing, the rice is washed to clean it of foreign matter and
of the smoky flavor of parching. It is then dried and ready to use
or store. Wild rice swells more than cultivated rice in cooking. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="p405" id="p405">[405]</a></span>
is often moistened with six times its bulk in water. The kernels
are about six times as long as thick and in cooking the ends curl backward
to meet in the center, thus differing from <i>Oryza sativa</i>, the white
man’s rice. The proper way to cook it Indian fashion is with deer
broth and season with maple sugar. Wild rice cooked with wild
fowl takes away the muddy or wild taste and is highly prized by those
whites who know its qualities.</p>

<h4>HYDROPHYLLACEAE (WATERLEAF FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Virginia Waterleaf</b> (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i> L.), “nebîneˈnanikweˈîag”<a name="FNanchor_139_55" id="FNanchor_139_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_55" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
[having hair on only one side]. The Pillager Ojibwe
use the root as a feed for ponies to make them fatten rapidly.</p>

<h4>JUGLANDACEAE (WALNUT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Shell-bark Hickory</b> (<i>Carya ovata</i> [Mill.] K. Koch.), “bagaˈ
nakoˈ bagan”. Hickory trees are scarce in the north, but the Ojibwe
appreciate the edible nuts.</p>

<p><b>Butternut</b> (<i>Juglans cinerea</i> L.), “bagaˈ nag”. Butternut is
plentiful in the north and in most Ojibwe territory, while the Black
Walnut is not to be found. They use the nuts for food and the hulls
for dye.</p>

<h4>LABIATAE (MINT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Wild Mint</b> (<i>Mentha arvensis</i> L. var. <i>canadensis</i> [L.] Briquet.)
“andegoˈ bîgons” [little crow leaf].<a name="FNanchor_140_56" id="FNanchor_140_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_56" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the
foliage to make a beverage tea.</p>

<p><b>Catnip</b> (<i>Nepeta cataria</i> L.), “tciˈ nameˈwûck” [big sturgeon leaf].
Catnip leaves are used by the Flambeau Ojibwe in making a beverage
tea.</p>

<h4>LEGUMINOSAE (PULSE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Hog Peanut</b> (<i>Amphicarpa pitcheri</i> T. &amp; G.), “bûgwaˈ dj mîskodiˈ
sîmîn” [unusual red bean]. The Pillager Ojibwe cook the beans
and are very fond of the unusual flavor imparted to their cooking in
this way. They also cook the roots, although they are really too
small to be considered of much importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p406" id="p406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Creamy Vetchling</b> (<i>Lathyrus ochroleucus</i> Hook.), “bûgwaˈdj
pînik” [unusual potato]. The Pillager Ojibwe use the root of this
plant as a sort of Indian potato, and store it in deep pits in the garden,
as they do their regular potatoes.</p>

<p><b>Navy Bean</b> (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.), “wabeniˈmînesa” [little
white berry]. The Ojibwe claim to have always had the sort of beans
that the white man uses and while their original Navy Bean is not
exactly like that of the white man, still it is near enough to be
confused with it.</p>

<p><b>Lima Bean</b> (<i>Phaseolus lunatus macrocarpus</i>),“wabeniˈ mîna”
[big white berry]. The Ojibwe also claim to have originally had the
Lima Bean, but that is doubtful.</p>

<p><b>Cranberry Pole Bean</b> (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.), “mêskodiˈ mînûn”
[red heart berry]. The Red Cranberry Pole Bean is the original
source of all our best commercial pole beans. The Indians cultivated
it in aboriginal times. They use it alone or in many peculiar combinations.</p>

<h4>LICHENS</h4>

<p>Tree Lichen (<i>Sticta glomulifera</i>), “jîngwakons wakun” [little white
pine and row of eggs] or “jîngwaˈkwak” [pine egg]. On the bark at
the base of an old White Pine, will be found lichens growing from the
ground to a height of perhaps three feet. The Ojibwe gather these
and boil them until they coagulate or “come together” like scrambled
eggs. They say that they taste like eggs “wawîn”, but they call
them “wakûn”, which is a term applied to the roe or eggs of a fish.
It is a favorite dish and a very ancient one.</p>

<h4>LILIACEAE (LILY FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Wild Onion</b> (<i>Allium cernuum</i> Roth.), “cîgagaˈ wûnj” [skunk
plant]. Both Pillager and Flambeau Ojibwe like the Wild Onion
and Wild Leek in the spring as an article of food.</p>

<p><b>Wild Leek</b> (<i>Allium tricoccum</i> Ait.), “bûgwaˈ djijîcaˈ gowûnj”
[unusual onion] “jîcago” really means skunk, and from this word
Chicago was named. This is the larger wild onion and is known as
Winabojo’s onion, or the one he pointed out for food. It is gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="p407" id="p407">[407]</a></span>
in the spring when it is round and plumper than in the fall. It is also
gathered and dried for future use. The Wild Leek is somewhat bitter,
while the smaller wild onion is sweet.</p>

<p><b>False Spikenard</b> (<i>Smilacina racemosa</i> [L.] Desf.), “agoñgosiˈ
wîdjiˈ bîk” [chipmunk root]. The Pillager Ojibwe use this root added
to oats to make a pony grow fat. The Flambeau Ojibwe also prepare
and eat the False Spikenard root. It is soaked in lye water and
parboiled to get rid of the lye, then cooked like potatoes.</p>

<h4>NYMPHAEACEAE (WATER LILY FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Sweet White Water Lily</b> (<i>Castalia odorata</i> [Ait.] Woodville &amp;
Wood), “odîteˈabûg wabîˈgwûn” [flat heart-shaped leaf, white flowered].
The Flambeau Ojibwe eat the buds of this water lily before they
open.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Lotus</b> (<i>Nelumbo lutea</i> (Willd.) Pers.), “wesawasaˈ kwuneˈk
odîteˈabûg” [yellow light, flat heart-shaped leaf].<a name="FNanchor_141_57" id="FNanchor_141_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_57" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Most of the
Wisconsin Ojibwe know about this favored wild potato; and also
use the hard chestnut-like seeds to roast and make into a sweet
meal. They cut off the terminal shoots, at either end of the underground
creeping rootstock and the remainder is their potato. These
shoots are similar in shape and size to a banana, and form the starchy
storage reservoirs for future growth. They have pores inside, but
have more substance to them than the stems. They are cut crosswise
and strung upon basswood strings, to hang from the rafters for
winter use. They are soaked when needed and then cooked with
venison, corn or beans.</p>

<h4>OLEACEAE (OLIVE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Red Ash</b> (<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i> Marsh.) “aˈgîmak” [snow-shoe
wood]. The cambium layer of the ash is scraped down in long, fluffy
layers and cooked. It is called “sagîmaˈ kwûn”, which incorporates
the name of the ash with “wûn” or eggs. They say it tastes like eggs.
Many other trees are given the same sort of treatment for food purposes.</p>

<h4>PINACEAE (PINE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>White Pine</b> (<i>Pinus strobus</i> L.), “jîngwaˈ k”. In the spring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p408" id="p408">[408]</a></span>
Ojibwe use the young staminate catkins of the pine to cook for food.
It is stewed with meat. One might think this would taste rather like
pitch, but they assured the writer that it was sweet and had no pitchy
flavor.</p>

<p><b>Hemlock</b> (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i> [L.] Carr.), “gagagiˈ wîc”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use the leaves of Hemlock to make a beverage tea. This
sort of tea is oftentimes used by the Indian Medicine man to carry
his medicaments and disguise the fact that the patient is taking
medicine.</p>

<h4>POLYPODIACEAE (FERN FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Brake</b> (<i>Pteris aquilina</i> L.), “ana ˈganûck” [general fern name].
The Flambeau Ojibwe are fond of young fern sprouts as a soup
material. The young fern tips, with coiled fronds, are about like
asparagus tips, only not stringy with fibrovascular bundles like asparagus.
The tips are thrown into hot water for an hour to rid them
of ants, then put into soup stock and thickened with flour. The
flavor resembles wild rice. Hunters are very careful to live wholly
upon this when stalking does in the spring. The doe feeds upon the
fronds and the hunter does also, so that his breath does not betray
his presence. He claims to be able to approach within twenty feet
without disturbing the deer, from which distance he can easily make
a fatal shot with his bow and arrow. After killing the deer, the hunter
will eat whatever strikes his fancy.</p>

<h4>RANUNCULACEAE (CROWFOOT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Marsh Marigold</b> (<i>Caltha palustris</i> L.), “o ˈgîteˈ bûg”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use the leaves as a green to cook with pork in the springtime.</p>

<h4>ROSACEAE (ROSE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Smooth Juneberry</b> (<i>Amelanchier laevis</i> Wiegand), “gozîgagoˈ
mînûn” [thorny berry]. According to John Whitefeather, Flambeau
Ojibwe, this is the name of the Juneberry, while Charley Burns on the
same reservation called it “bîsegaˈ gwomîn”. Both knew it only as a
food, although some tribes use the bark as a medicine. Juneberries
were also dried for winter use, the Indians often preferring them to
blueberries. The Pillager Ojibwe also use them as a food and use the
bark as a medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p409" id="p409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Red Haw Apple</b> (<i>Crataegus</i> sp.), “mînesagaˈ wûnj”. The Pillager
Ojibwe use the haw apples as a food in the fall of the year.</p>

<p><b>Wild Strawberry</b> (<i>Fragaria virginiana</i> Duchesne), “odeˈ imîn”
[heart berry]. Both Flambeau and Pillager Ojibwe have the same
name for the Wild Strawberry, and call it the heart berry from its
shape and color. They are very fond of it in season and make preserves
of it for winter use.</p>

<p><b>Wild Plum</b> (<i>Prunus nigra</i> Ait.), “bûgeˈ sanatîg”. The Pillager
Ojibwe find quantities of the Wild Plum in thickets and gather it for
food and for preserves.</p>

<p><b>Pin Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus pennsylvanica</i> L.f.), “baeˈ wimînûn”. The
Pin Cherry is abundant around the Flambeau Reservation and the
Ojibwe are fond of it. It is an education in itself to see a group of
Ojibwe women working on mats with a supply of fruit laden branches
beside them. With one hand they will start a stream of berries into
the mouth and the stream of cherry stones ejected from the other
corner of the mouth seems ceaseless. The Pillager Ojibwe also have
the tree and use it in the same manner.</p>

<p><b>Sand Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus pumila</i> L.), “sewaˈkomîn”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe find plenty of this species on sandy openings in the forest, and
gather the fruit for food.</p>

<p><b>Wild Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus serotina</i> Ehrh.), “okweˈ mîn” [worm from
egg of a fly]. The Flambeau Ojibwe prefer this cherry to all other
wild cherries, and dry it for winter use. Some of them also make
whiskey from the ripe cherries.</p>

<p><b>Choke Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus virginiana</i> L.), “saweˈ mîn”. Although
the fruit of this cherry is sufficiently acrid to be unsatisfactory to the
whites as a food, the Pillager Ojibwe like it, especially after the fruit
has been frosted.</p>

<p><b>High Bush Blackberry</b> (<i>Rubus allegheniensis</i> Porter), “odatagaˈ
gomîc” [blackberry stem].<a name="FNanchor_142_58" id="FNanchor_142_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_58" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The Flambeau Ojibwe relish the Blackberry
and also the Dewberry (<i>Rubus villosus</i> Ait.) although we found<span class="pagenum"><a name="p410" id="p410">[410]</a></span>
no specimen nor distinctive name for it. They make a jam of the
berries for winter use.</p>

<p><b>Red Raspberry</b> (<i>Rubus idaeus</i> L. var. <i>aculaetissimus</i> [C. A. Mey.]
Regel &amp; Tiling) “meskwaˈ mîn” [red berry]. This is a favorite fresh
fruit of the Flambeau Ojibwe and is also used for making jams for
winter use.</p>

<h4>SALICACEAE (WILLOW FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Large-toothed Aspen</b> (<i>Populus grandidentata</i> Michx.), “asadiˈ”
[bitter bark]. The Ojibwe scrape the cambium layer to obtain a food
which is boiled and is something like eggs. They also scrape the cambium
of several other trees for food.</p>

<h4>SAXIFRAGACEAE (SAXIFRAGE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Prickly Gooseberry</b> (<i>Ribes cynosbati</i> L.), “meˈ skwacaboˈ mînûk”
[red berries with thorns]. The Flambeau Ojibwe relish these berries
when ripe and make them into preserves for winter use.</p>

<p><b>Wild Black Currant</b> (<i>Ribes americanum</i> Mill.), “amîˈkomîn”
[beaver berries], shown in <a href="#plate70">plate 70</a>, fig. 1. The Pillager Ojibwe eat
these berries fresh, in jams, and preserves and dry them for winter.
In the winter, a favorite dish is wild currants cooked with sweet corn.
The Flambeau Indians use them in a like manner, but call them “kagagîtciˈ
mîn” [raven berries].</p>

<p><b>Wild Red Currant</b> (<i>Ribes triste</i> Pall.), “mîcitciˈ mînûk”. The
Flambeau Ojibwe gather these currants and use them as they do
the Wild Black Currants.</p>

<p><b>Smooth Gooseberry</b> (<i>Ribes oxyacanthoides</i> L.), “caboˈ mînûk”
[smooth berry]. The Flambeau Ojibwe gather this berry for fresh
food, and also make it into preserves for winter use. It is often cooked
with sweet corn.</p>

<h4>SOLANACEAE (NIGHTSHADE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Ojibwe Potato</b> (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.), “opîn” [potato].<a name="FNanchor_143_59" id="FNanchor_143_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_59" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
The Ojibwe have cultivated this early potato, according to their
traditions since aboriginal times, and it surely looks primitive enough.
It is round in circumference, about two or three inches long, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="p411" id="p411">[411]</a></span>
purplish flesh, and never cooks to a mealy consistency. It is much
prized for soups and is always firm and crisp when cooked. White
Cloud’s potato patch on Bear Island, Leech Lake, Minnesota, is
shown in <a href="#plate58">plate 58</a>, fig. 1.</p>

<h4>URTICACEAE (NETTLE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Hop</b> (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.) “jiˈwîciniˈ goniˈ bûg”. The Pillager
Ojibwe often use the hop fruit as a substitute for baking soda.</p>

<h4>VITACEAE (VINE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Virginia Creeper</b> (<i>Psedera quinquefolia</i> [L.] Greene), “manîdoˈ
bimakwît” [spirit twisted]. The Pillager Ojibwe say that the root
of this vine was cooked and eaten a long time ago by their people
and that it had been given as a special food by Winabojo.</p>

<p><b>River-bank Grape</b> (<i>Vitis vulpina</i> L.), “cîˈ wimînûn”. The Pillager
Ojibwe use these grapes after they have been frosted, and make
them into jelly for winter use.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="VEGETAL_FIBERS" id="VEGETAL_FIBERS"></a>OJIBWE VEGETAL FIBERS</h2>

<p>The Ojibwe Indians have always been far removed from the beaten
paths of the white men, and for this reason make good use of their
native plant materials. Oft times, it seems to the white man that
they bestow considerable labor, upon making cord, string, mats,
baskets and similar articles that might as easily be purchased at a
store. But money is not plentiful, and many of the things that can
be purchased have inferior lasting qualities. Disgust for a poor substitute,
pride in their own resourcefulness, and the habit of centuries
has kept them constantly proving that they are the master
of their environment and continuing to make their products in the
good old Ojibwe way.</p>

<p>Outside of yarn sashes, they have not woven textiles for a long
time. Perhaps the last of their textile work is in storage bags made
from nettle fiber or basswood string. Cedar bark fiber was used long
ago for some coarse textiles but not within the past century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p412" id="p412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Their bark wigwams are quite comfortable and probably more
Ojibwe live in these native houses, shown in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>, fig. 2, and <a href="#plate58">plate
58</a>, fig. 2, than in frame houses. Certainly they use more of these
than any other Wisconsin tribe. The mats for the benches or beds
at the outer rim of the wigwam, or for the floor inside, are skillfully
made. They can make their wigwams wind and waterproof with
sewed cat-tail mats and birch bark, as shown in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>, fig. 2, and can
even live very comfortably in their wigwams in sub-zero temperatures.</p>

<p>There are several agency schools scattered about the reservations,
where the children may go to school, and happily the teachers usually
encourage the children to learn their own Indian arts. The schools
are really boarding schools, where the children stay continuously for
nine months, being completely clothed by the Indian service. Sometimes
boys and girls will escape and run home to hide, but the disciplinarian
and Indian policeman usually ferret them out and bring
them back, or else seize the father and hold him in jail until the scholar
is produced again. Indian children are taught more of the useful
arts and household arts than are the white children, but also have
access to a college education through their university or normal
schools.</p>

<p>Under the head of vegetal fibers, we also consider their uses
of forest trees, since these are so closely related. As before, the plant
families are listed alphabetically, and descriptions of uses are made
along the same lines as in the preceding divisions of this bulletin.</p>

<h3><a name="FIBER_PLANTS" id="FIBER_PLANTS"></a>OJIBWE FIBER PLANTS</h3>

<h4>ACERACEAE (MAPLE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Red Maple</b> (<i>Acer rubrum</i> L.), “cicigîmeˈwîc”. This leaf is frequently
used in the Ojibwe beadwork designs. In fact, many leaves,
flowers and fruits furnish designs. Since the plants are sacred to
their midewiwin or medicine lodge, it is common for them to use especially
valuable remedies in their designs. These may be worked in
either porcupine quills or beads. Shell and copper beads were used in
the older work, while tiny glass beads obtainable from the whites are
now used. Indian women are usually most apt at their own aboriginal<span class="pagenum"><a name="p413" id="p413">[413]</a></span>
designs and do a rather poor job, when they are given a white man’s
design to copy. In the early days, the Indian men drew outline pictures
on birchbark scrolls to remind them of midewiwin rituals, practices
and medicines. Indian women experimented with plant materials laid
upon birch bark until they found the design that suited them. Deer
horns burned in the fire to furnish charcoal or else flour was used to
coat the underside of a leaf, which was then pressed upon birch bark
to leave its outline as from a carbon copy. The birch bark design
would be placed beneath the native bead loom, as shown in <a href="#plate48">plate 48</a>,
fig. 1, and the pattern copied in beads. Sashes, anklets, bracelets, kneelets,
belts, coats and waists were beaded, also moccasins. The public is
not very discerning in choosing real Indian designs, but the ethnologist
can quickly pick the originals, even though he may never have
seen that tribe of Indians before.</p>

<p><b>Mountain Maple</b> (<i>Acer spicatum</i> Lam.), “cacagobiˈmûk” [emetic
bark]. The three-lobed leaf of the Mountain Maple is a great favorite
with Ojibwe women for design work for beading, and it is more often
seen than any other kind of leaf.</p>

<p><b>Sugar Maple</b> (<i>Acer saccharum</i> Marsh.), “înênatîg” [Indian tree].<a name="FNanchor_144_60" id="FNanchor_144_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_60" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Paddles for stirring maple sugar or wild rice while scorching or parching
it, bowls and many other objects of utility were made by the
Ojibwe from this wood.</p>

<h4>APOCYNACEAE (DOGBANE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Spreading Dogbane</b> (<i>Apocynum androsaemifolium</i> L.), “wesaˈwûskwûn”
[nearly blue flowers]. The Flambeau women used to use the
outer rind for fine sewing. In the fall, when mature this fiber makes
one of the strongest native fibers, stronger even than the cultivated
hemp to which it is related.</p>

<h4>BETULACEAE (BIRCH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Paper Birch</b> (<i>Betula alba</i> L. var. papyrifera [Marsh.] Spach)
“wîgwas”. Birch occupies almost as important a position in the life
of the Ojibwe as dates do in the life of an Arabian or cocoanuts in the
life of a South Sea Islander. The bark is used for buckets, baskets,
wigwam covering, and canoes. Patterns for their decorative art were<span class="pagenum"><a name="p414" id="p414">[414]</a></span>
made upon the bark; records of their medicine lodge ritual were kept
on its virgin surface. It and cedar form the two most sacred trees of the
Ojibwe, both of which are so useful to them. They regard the birch
bark as a distinct contribution from Winabojo and point to the fact
that it is the last part of the tree to decay. It keeps its form even after
the wood has changed to dust and can be readily slipped from the
wood in decayed logs. It also has the property of protecting from decay
articles stored in it. They claim that a birch is never struck by lightning,
hence offers a safe harbor in a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>No birch or cedar is gathered by the Ojibwe without due offering
of tobacco to Winabojo and Grandmother Earth. Families make
a pilgrimage to birch groves during the latter part of June and in July
to gather their supply of birch bark, because it peels most easily at that
time. As everyone knows, there are many layers of bark on a birch
tree ranging from the thinnest paper to quite heavy pieces that
make very durable canoes.</p>

<p>George L. Waite, Honorary Curator of Botany in this museum, made
a special series of pictures, thirty in number, detailing every step in the
manufacture of their canoes or “tciman” as they call them. Ogabeˈgijîg
[rift in the clouds] and his wife Cawasînoˈkwe [rays of light from cloud]
both 80 years old, about the only old couple at Lac du Flambeau, still
remembering the proper Ojibwe method of making a birchbark canoe
were engaged to carry on the work. Important steps are shown in
plates accompanying this bulletin.</p>

<p>To find a tree with thick bark suitable for canoe-making often
necessitates a considerable journey on foot as it did in this case. The
trunk should be ten to fifteen inches in diameter, smooth and straight
as can be selected. Paper birches are of slow growth and the usual
specimen of that diameter will be from fifty to seventy years old. This
tree was collected with all the proper ceremony. Into a hole in the
ground at the base of the tree, tobacco was placed as an offering.
Tobacco was smoked by the man, who saluted the cardinal points of
the compass, and likewise heaven and earth. The tree was then cut
down. They say that usually it will be left standing on the stump, so
that the bark may be undamaged, but for this canoe where the outside
of the bark becomes the inside of the canoe, they felled crossed logs to
hold it off the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p415" id="p415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>To remove the bark, a long perpendicular slit is made the
length desired. From this cut the bark is laid back on either side,
with an axe, and peeled from the log as shown in <a href="#plate52">plate 52</a>, fig. 1. To
overcome the natural curl of the bark, it is then rolled up with the inner
side outmost, in proper lengths and tied with inner bark of the basswood,
which is their ready cord material. With a tump-line over the
head, as shown in <a href="#plate52">plate 52</a>, fig. 2, the man is ready to carry the bark
home, where he will make the canoe.</p>

<p>The framework was made of White Cedar or Arbor Vitae because it
is light, elastic, strong and easy to split. In <a href="#plate53">plate 53</a>, fig. 1, Ogabeˈgijîg
is shown splitting the cedar log to obtain the ribs and framework.
There are two lengths, sixteen feet for top rails, and six feet for ribs,
as shown in <a href="#plate53">plate 53</a>, fig. 2. The curves of the prow and stern are obtained
by slitting a stave twelve times so that it may be bent at right
angles, tied securely with basswood string, and held in place until
dried as shown in <a href="#plate54">plate 54</a>, fig. 1.</p>

<p>A staked form eighteen feet long is next laid out on the ground, as
shown in <a href="#plate54">plate 54</a>, fig. 2. The bark is secured between the two stakes so
that it cannot slip and is then ready for sewing together. Large rocks
are piled inside to overcome any tendency of the bark to curl. The sewing
material is the root of Jack Pine. These are especially suitable
since they are long and straight. Ogabeˈgijîg is seen pulling them out of
the ground after digging with a grub hoe, in <a href="#plate55">plate 55</a>, fig. 1. The central
core is tough and is about the same diameter at the tip as it is close to
the main trunk of the tree. It is split into two and coiled, to furnish a
very tough flexible cord. The coils are shown with Cawasînoˈkwe
under the Jack Pine tree from whence they came in <a href="#plate55">plate 55</a>, fig. 2.
Both cedar sticks and root fiber are sunk in the lake till needed.</p>

<p>Sewing makes awl holes necessary, and a White Oak wood awl is
used. Both ends are drawn through the same hole with a lock stitch,
like the shoemaker used to use in putting on half soles. All holes
must be caulked and made watertight. Pitch is obtained from a Balsam,
Norway Pine, or White Pine. Notches made in the tree trunk fill with
resin in ten days. This is boiled with tallow in a kettle, as shown in
<a href="#plate56">plate 56</a>, fig. 1. The resin is cooked a second time to obtain the pitch
and Hemlock or Larch bark is used to furnish the heat, because it
produces more steady heat than a wood fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p416" id="p416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Cawasînoˈkwe is seen again sewing the canoe into its form in <a href="#plate56">plate
56</a>, figure 2, and is shown applying pitch to the seams in <a href="#plate57">plate 57</a>, figure
1. Decorations are made with native dyes such as blue clay and red
ochre. Nowadays white men’s colors are used and clan marks painted
on each end. Ogabeˈgijîg uses a bear picture for his clan mark while
Cawasînoˈkwe belongs to the chicken clan. The finished canoe is seen
in <a href="#plate57">plate 57</a>, fig. 2, as they are launching it upon Flambeau Lake. Very
few Ojibwe can still make a real birch bark canoe in this manner and
the museum considers this series of photographs a valuable one.</p>

<p>The tree is later salvaged for firewood, but the bark may be used
right away as soon as obtained. Emergency trays or buckets may be
fashioned at once in the woods, or the bark may be stored for future use.
The application of heat is all that is necessary to bend it in any shape
desired. Although it is highly inflammable, still buckets of birch bark
can be used to cook meats. Where water covers the inside of the vessel,
it will not burn. The Ojibwe woman saves scraps of birchbark to
kindle or light fires with them. A handy torch which will burn all
night can be made by rolling birch bark tightly. It is often used by
the Ojibwe in lieu of candles.</p>

<p>Nearly any kitchen utensil common to the white man, can be
duplicated in birchbark by the Ojibwe. Even funnels for pouring hot
lard are easily made. The mokoks or baskets are made for gathering
and storing berries, for storing maple sugar, dried fish, meat, or any
food. The birchbark keeps the food from spoiling. Some of the mokoks
for gathering berries or carrying maple sap, have bark handles like
bucket handles, as shown in <a href="#plate49">plate 49</a>, fig. 1, while larger storage baskets
have no handles, but a lid, or sometimes a flap of the basket itself is
used to close it tightly. All sorts of drying trays are made from birch
bark. Shallow trays for winnowing wild rice are also made of it.</p>

<p>Sheets of bark are sewed together with basswood string and made
into birchbark rolls, used as waterproof roofing for wigwams, as shown
in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>, fig. 2. Sticks tied across the end of the roll keep it from
splitting and tearing. A fine opportunity to see these bark rolls was
afforded during the Court of Neptune pageant in 1926 on the lake
front in Milwaukee, when the writer brought down over a hundred
Ojibwe Indians from Lac Court Oreilles, Wisconsin, and set up a model
old time village of eleven wigwams. There they lived for a week demonstrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="p417" id="p417">[417]</a></span>
their former methods of life, jerking meats over open fires, as
shown in <a href="#plate47">plate 47</a>, fig. 2, and practicing their native arts and crafts.</p>

<p><b>Low Birch</b> (<i>Betula pumila</i> L. var. <i>glandulifera</i> Regel), “bîneˈmîc”
[partridge bush]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the twigs of this
dwarf birch for the ribs of baskets, where sweet grass is the weaving
material.</p>

<p><b>Hazelnut</b> (<i>Corylus americana</i> Walt.), “mûkwoˈbagaˈnak”.<a name="FNanchor_145_61" id="FNanchor_145_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_61" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
A crooked stick with an enlarged base such as can often be obtained
in a hazel bush makes the favorite drum stick for the Flambeau Ojibwe.
The finer twigs are bound into a bundle, with the tips sheared, to serve
as a primitive broom or brush to be used on the bare ground in the
wigwam. The finer twigs may also be used as ribs in making woven
baskets for collecting or storing acorns or hard fruits.</p>

<h4>CAPRIFOLIACEAE (HONEYSUCKLE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Downy Arrow-wood</b> (<i>Viburnum pubescens</i> [Ait.] Pursh), “wabanweˈak”
[east stick]. The bark of this species furnished one of the ingredients
of a Pillager Ojibwe kinnikinnik, which the writer smoked and
pronounces good.</p>

<h4>COMPOSITAE (COMPOSITE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Woolly Yarrow</b> (<i>Achillea lanulosa</i> Nutt.), “wabîgwon” [white
flower]. The flower heads are used in the kinnikinnik mixture for
smoking by the Flambeau Ojibwe. This mixture, is not however
smoked for pleasure, but in medicine lodge ceremonies for ceremonial
purposes.</p>

<p><b>White Sage</b> (<i>Artemisia ludoviciana</i> Nutt.), “bebejiˈgoganjîˈ wîˈngûsk”
[horse hollow tube]. While the Pillager Ojibwe use this plant
as a horse medicine, they report that their neighbors the Sioux use it
in their smoking tobacco.</p>

<h4>CORNACEAE (DOGWOOD FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Alternate-leaved Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i> L. f.), “mosoˈmîc”
[moose tree]. The bark of this dogwood is used for kinnikinnik, while
the twigs are used in thatching and for various purposes by the Pillager
Ojibwe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p418" id="p418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Panicled Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus paniculata</i> L’Her.), “meskwabiˈmîc”
[red tree]. The Flambeau Ojibwe make kinnikinnik from the bark of
this species for smoking.</p>

<h4>CYPERACEAE (SEDGE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Wool Grass</b> (<i>Scirpus cyperinus</i> [L.] Kunth.), “gaîeˈwûckûk”.
The Flambeau Ojibwe use these small rushes for a certain kind of mat,
and formerly used them for woven bags for storage.</p>

<p><b>Great Bulrush</b> (<i>Scirpus validus</i> Vahl.), “jîkaˈmiûskûn”. The
Pillager Ojibwe use this rush for their best mats. The bleached rushes
are shown in <a href="#plate51">plate 51</a>, fig. 1, after they have been immersed in water
for a few days and then cleansed. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the same
rush in the same way. They select long rushes, with small diameters,
so that the pith content is small. When the mat is in service, such a
fiber will not crush readily. The rush when gathered is an intense
green, white only at the base where it stands in water. All rushes
must first be bleached pure white, and afterwards colored as desired.
They are pulled, rather than cut, in order to obtain the maximum
length. When thoroughly bleached and dried, they dye them with
white men’s dyes. Formerly they used native dyes, which they really
prefer. The writer tried for a long time to secure the proper dyes for
Whitefeather, but without success. They had a small quantity of
German dye bought in 1914, which was satisfactory, but the six lots
sent them were not equal to the small sample in penetration nor permanence.
The bleached rushes preponderate in any rug, and are ivory-white
in color. The finished rug or mat is three feet wide and from four
to eight feet long, and sells for from $8 to $30.<a name="FNanchor_146_62" id="FNanchor_146_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_62" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The edge is bound
securely with nettle fiber cord. The Flambeau Ojibwe use a more general
term in referring to the rushes “anaˈganûck” meaning rushes in
general.</p>

<h4>EQUISETACEAE (HORSETAIL FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Scouring Rush</b> (<i>Equisetum hyemale</i> L.), “gîjiˈbînûsk” [duck plant].
The Pillager Ojibwe, besides using this for a medicine, employ a handful
of the stems to scour their kettles and pans.</p>

<h4>FAGACEAE (BEECH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>White Oak</b> (<i>Quercus alba</i> L.), “mîtîˈgomîc”. The wood is of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="p419" id="p419">[419]</a></span>
value to all the Ojibwe, especially for making awls to punch holes
in birch bark as they are sewing it with Jack Pine roots. They use it in
making wigwams and for several other things. In fact, all the oaks
are used and appreciated.</p>

<h4>GRAMINEAE (GRASS FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Sweet Grass</b> (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i> L.), “wîckoˈbimûckoˈsi”
[sweet grass]. While Sweet Grass is scarce around the Flambeau and
Pillager reservations, they secure it elsewhere for making baskets,
and say that in olden times it was used ceremonially because of its
persistent sweet scent.</p>

<h4>HYDROPHYLLACEAE (WATERLEAF FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Virginia Waterleaf</b> (<i>Hydrophyllum virginianum</i> L.), “nebîneˈnanikweˈîag.”
[having hair on only one side]. According to White
Cloud, Pillager Ojibwe, this root was chopped up and put into pony
feed to make them grow fat and have glossy hair.</p>

<h4>JUGLANDACEAE (WALNUT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Shell-bark Hickory</b> (<i>Carya ovata</i> [Mill.] K. Koch.), “mîtîgwabaˈk”
[wooden?]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the wood for making bows.
Some are quite particular about the piece of wood they select, choosing
a billet from the tree that includes heart wood on one side and sap
wood on the other. The heart wood is the front of the bow in use, while
the sap wood is nearest the user. It is likewise a wood of general utility.</p>

<h4>JUNCACEAE (RUSH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Dudley’s Rush</b> (<i>Juncus dudleyi</i> Wiegand), “jîgomiˈûskûn”. The
Pillager Ojibwe use this tiny rush in their finest mat work, for small
pieces.</p>

<h4>LEGUMINOSAE (PULSE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Creamy Vetchling</b> (<i>Lathyrus ochroleucus</i>, Hook.), “bûgwaˈdjûk
pîniˈkmîneˈbûg” [unusual potato, berry leaf]. The leaves and roots of
this were used by the Pillager Ojibwe to put spirit into a pony just before
they expected to race him.</p>

<p><b>Marsh Vetchling</b> (<i>Lathyrus palustris</i> L.), “bebejiˈgoganjiˈ mackiˈki”
[horse medicine or literally “animal with only one hoof” medicine].
The foliage was specially fed to a pony by the Pillager Ojibwe to make
it grow fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p420" id="p420">[420]</a></span></p>

<h4>MYRICACEAE (BAYBERRY FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Sweet Fern</b> (<i>Myrica asplenifolia</i> L.), “gibaimeˈnûnagwûs” [coverer].
This word is almost the same as the Menomini word for Sweet
Fern and means the same thing. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the leaves
to line their buckets when they pick blueberries and also cover them
with the leaves, to keep them from spoiling.</p>

<h4>OLEACEAE (OLIVE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Black Ash</b> (<i>Fraxinus nigra</i> Marsh). Black Ash is the wood chosen
for basketry splints by the Ojibwe. While our Wisconsin Indians are
skilled at basket making, their product is more useful than highly
ornamental. If they had the yucca leaves, the devil’s claw fiber, the
sumac twigs, the bunch grass, and the other splendid basketry fibers of
the southwestern Indians, no doubt they would make equally fine baskets.
The Wisconsin Indians exercise possibly more ingenuity in
gathering and preparing their basketry material. They select a Black
Ash log from a swamp and peel it carefully. Then with a butcher
knife, they make a cut about a half inch deep and by pounding with
an axe head cause it to split up from the log, as seen in <a href="#plate50">plate 50</a>, figure 1.
By inserting wedges, and continually pounding ahead of them, they
cause the wood to separate along the annual rings. Then a further cut
is made in the center of the annual ring and the two halves peeled back
leaving a glossy surface. These splints are curled up into coils to be
immersed in kettles of dye stuffs. Then they are woven by the women
of the household as shown in <a href="#plate50">plate 50</a>, figure 2.</p>

<p><b>Red Ash</b> (<i>Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i> Marsh.), “aˈgîmak” [snow-shoe
wood]. All ash wood is quite valuable to the Ojibwe, as they use it
for bows and arrows, snow-shoe frames, sleds, basketry splints and
cradle boards as shown in <a href="#plate49">plate 49</a>, fig. 2. The Red Ash is not used for
the basketry splints when they can get Black Ash.</p>

<h4>PINACEAE (PINE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Balsam Fir</b> (<i>Abies balsamea</i> [L.] Mill.), “jîngoˈb” [any kind of
fir tree]. More properly “jîngoˈb pikewaˈndag” [fir tree that goes up to
a peak]. The Ojibwe chop a hole in the trunk and allow the resin to
accumulate and harden. When gathered and boiled it becomes a canoe
pitch. It is usually boiled a second time with the addition of suet or fat
to make a canoe pitch of the proper consistency. Another name given
the tree is “jîngoˈbandag”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p421" id="p421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tamarack</b> (<i>Larix laricina</i> [DuRoi] Koch), “mûckiˈgwatîg” [swamp
tree]. Larch roots are also used as a sewing material by the Flambeau
and Couderay Ojibwe and they used to sew canoes with them. They
also make bags from the root fibers, which are considered especially
durable.</p>

<p><b>Black Spruce</b> (<i>Picea mariana</i> [Mill.] BSP.), “jîngwûp” [its name].
The Flambeau and Couderay Ojibwe used these roots to sew canoes,
and from incisions in the bark gathered the resin to be boiled with
tallow to make pitch for caulking canoes.</p>

<p><b>Jack Pine</b> (<i>Pinus banksiana</i> Lamb.), “gîgaˈndag” [its name]. Jack
Pine roots have ever been esteemed by all Ojibwe as fine sewing material
for their canoes and other coarse and durable sewing. They dig
the roots with a grub hoe as shown in <a href="#plate55">plate 55</a>, fig. 1, and often find
them fifty or sixty feet long. These are split lengthwise into two halves
starting at the tree end, and are wrapped in coils as shown in <a href="#plate55">plate 55</a>, fig.
2. They are then sunk in the lake which loosens the bark and enables
them to be scraped clean, as well as adding to their flexibility. They are
an ivory white when used and very tough and flexible. An Ojibwe
woman is shown sewing a canoe with them in <a href="#plate56">plate 56</a>, figure 2.</p>

<p><b>Norway Pine</b> (<i>Pinus resinosa</i> Ait.), “abakwanûgiˈmûg” [bark in
plates], shown in <a href="#plate63">plate 63</a>, fig. 2. The Flambeau Ojibwe gather resin
from the Norway Pine just as they do from the White Pine, Balsam and
Spruce, by chopping a hole into the trunk and collecting the resin as it
forms. It is boiled twice, being combined with tallow the second time,
to make a serviceable waterproof pitch. This is not only used for caulking
canoes, but for mending roof rolls of birch bark and other things.
The wood is also utilized.</p>

<p><b>White Pine</b> (<i>Pinus strobus</i> L.), “jîngwaˈkwacêskweˈdo” [white
pine cone], shown in <a href="#plate63">plate 63</a>, fig. 1. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the
pitch from the boiled cones, along with the resin that flows from boxed
trees, for caulking and waterproofing purposes.</p>

<p><b>Arbor Vitae</b> (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i> L.), “giˈjîg” [cedar or sky]. The
Ojibwe worships the Arbor Vitae or White Cedar and the Paper or
Canoe Birch, as the two most useful trees in the forest. The pungent
fragrance of the leaves and wood of the Arbor Vitae are always an<span class="pagenum"><a name="p422" id="p422">[422]</a></span>
acceptable incense to Winabojo, and the wood is their choice for light,
strong straight-grained canoe frames and ribs, as shown in <a href="#plate53">plate 53</a>,
figure 2. In earlier times, the tough stringy bark was used in making
fiber bags, but these are scarcely ever seen today.</p>

<p><b>Hemlock</b> (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i> [L.] Carr.), “gagagiˈwîc” [its name].
Hemlock bark was used by the Flambeau Ojibwe for fuel, when boiling
their pitch the second time, because the heat from it was more easily
regulated than that from a wood fire.</p>

<h4>ROSACEAE (ROSE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Hawthorn</b> (<i>Crataegus</i> sp.), “mîneˈsagaˈwûnj”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe women use the sharp thorns for sewing awls on finer work
such as buckskin sewing with sinew.</p>

<h4>SALICACEAE (WILLOW FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Shining Willow</b> (<i>Salix lucida</i> Muhl.), “azisiˈgobmîc” [its name].
The Flambeau Ojibwe use this bark for their kinnikinnik or native
smoking mixture. It is peeled and toasted over a fire and reduced to
flakes.</p>

<h4>SPHAGNACEAE (SPHAGNUM MOSS FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Sphagnum</b> (<i>Sphagnum dusenii</i> C. Jens.), “asaˈgûmîg” [moss].
The Flambeau and Pillager Ojibwe find Sphagnum Moss, shown in
<a href="#plate66">plate 66</a>, fig. 1, readily available. They gather and dry it to make
mattresses.</p>

<h4>TILIACEAE (BASSWOOD FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Basswood</b> (<i>Tilia americana</i> L.), “wigub” [its name]. The tough
fibrous bark of young basswood trees furnishes all Ojibwe with ready
cordage and string in the woods, but it is also prepared by the women
for future use. They strip the bark and peel the outer edge from the
inner fiber with their teeth. The rolls are then kept in coils or are boiled
and kept as coils until needed, being soaked again when used, to make
them pliable. While they have countless uses for this cordage
perhaps the most important is in tying the poles together for the
framework of the wigwam or medicine lodge, as shown in <a href="#plate46">plate 46</a>,
figure 2. When these crossings of poles are lashed together with wet
bark fiber, it is easy to get a tight knot which shrinks when dry and
makes an even tighter joint. The bark of an elm or a balsam, cut into<span class="pagenum"><a name="p423" id="p423">[423]</a></span>
broad strips is then sewed into place on the framework with basswood
string. In olden times, an oak wood awl was used to punch holes in
the bark, but at Leech Lake when they made the writer’s wigwam, as
shown in <a href="#plate58">plate 58</a>, figure 2, they used an old file end for an awl. The
writer lived in this new wigwam all the time he was among the Pillager
Ojibwe and scarcely a night passed without a group of them visiting
him and sitting around the campfire, telling old time stories.</p>

<h4>TYPHACEAE (CAT-TAIL FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Cat-tail</b> (<i>Typha latifolia</i> L.), “abûkweˈskwe” [wigwam cover;
that is, the plant leaves]. The Flambeau Ojibwe women use the cat-tail
leaves to make wind and rain-proof mats to be placed on the sides
of the medicine lodge or any temporary wigwam or sweat lodge. They
sew with a bone needle and nettle or basswood fiber with a hidden
stitch, and bind the edges securely with their sewing cord. These
mats are made quite large to cover the wigwams, and are rolled
and carried around with them. They are not quite rain-proof as a
roofing material, so birchbark rolls are used for that purpose. The
fuzz or seed of the cat-tail is called “bebamasûˈn” [it flies around],
and is used to make mattresses and sleeping bags. They say the fuzz
will blind one if it gets into his eyes. They gather the heads and boil
them first, which causes all the bugs to come out of them. Then they
dry them and strip the fuzz, to make a mattress, which they claim is as
soft as feathers, but very prone to mat together, so that it must be
shaken often and thoroughly. They also make a quilt of it, and from
the quilt a sleeping bag. This is declared to be soft and warm in
the coldest weather.</p>

<h4>URTICACEAE (NETTLE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Wood Nettle</b> (<i>Laportea canadensis</i> [L.] Gaud.), “masanaˈtîg”
[woods fiber]. The Pillager Ojibwe say that their old people used the
rind of this nettle as a sewing fiber.</p>

<p><b>Slippery Elm</b> (<i>Ulmus fulva</i> Michx.), “aniˈb” [its name]. The
Pillager Ojibwe strip this bark to use as a wigwam cover, for the sides
of the wigwam.</p>

<p><b>Lyall’s Nettle</b> (<i>Urtica lyalli</i> Wats.), “masan” [woods]. In aboriginal
times, the Flambeau Ojibwe used the bark or rind of this nettle
to give them a fine, stout sewing fiber.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p424" id="p424">[424]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VEGETAL_DYES" id="VEGETAL_DYES"></a>OJIBWE VEGETAL DYES</h2>

<p>Some of the old people among all Ojibwe still use vegetable and
native dye stuffs, especially upon a mat or piece of material that they
expect to keep for their own use. For the tourist trade, they will use
“Diamond” dyes or any sort they can get as they are not especially
interested in how well the color lasts in that case. John Whitefeather,
Flambeau Ojibwe, asked the writer to find a good dye for them, as he
had been unable to buy any since 1914. Several lots were sent to him,
but none was found that had the penetration and permanence of the
German dyes that he had before the war. He had to resort to native
dye stuffs to get those qualities, but, of course, could not get
the same range of colors in native dye stuffs. That was the main reason
he sought more of the white man’s dyes.</p>

<p>They boil the material they wish to color in the mixture of plant
parts and some earth to set the color. For this they use various clays,
the red or black sand that bubbles up in a spring, or stone dust, perhaps
with a few, rusty, iron nails thrown in the kettle for good
measure. Sometimes the bark of Black Oak (<i>Quercus velutina</i> Lam.)
was used to set the color.</p>

<h3><a name="DYE_PLANTS" id="DYE_PLANTS"></a>OJIBWE DYE PLANTS</h3>

<h4>ANACARDIACEAE (SUMAC FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Smooth Sumac</b> (<i>Rhus glabra</i> L.), “bakwaˈnak” [binding tree].
The Flambeau Ojibwe use the inner bark and the central pith of the
stem of the Smooth Sumac, mixed with Bloodroot to obtain an
orange color. The material is boiled in the mixture.</p>

<p><b>Staghorn Sumac</b> (<i>Rhus typhina</i> L.), “bakwanaˈtîg”. The Pillager
Ojibwe do not have the Smooth Sumac, but use the Staghorn
Sumac in the same way as the Flambeau Ojibwe use the other. The
writer was unable to discover how they set the color unless it was with
some stone dust that accumulated in the base of the kettle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p425" id="p425">[425]</a></span></p>

<h4>BALSAMINACEAE (TOUCH-ME-NOT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Spotted Touch-me-not</b> (<i>Impatiens biflora</i> Walt.), “oˈsawaskodjiˈbîk”
[yellow root]. The whole plant is used by the Pillager
Ojibwe to make a yellow dye and the material is boiled in the mixture
with a few rusty nails.</p>

<h4>BETULACEAE (BIRCH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Speckled Alder</b> (<i>Alnus incana</i> [L.] Moench.), “wadoˈb” [its name].
The Flambeau Ojibwe use the inner bark for dyeing a light yellow, or
with other ingredients to get a red, red brown or black. In occasional
cases where sweet grass is dyed reddish yellow, the woman chews the
inner bark and draws a wisp of sweet grass through her mouth weaving
it in for color.</p>

<p><b>Paper Birch</b> (<i>Betula alba</i> L. var. <i>papyrifera</i> [Marsh.] Spach),
“wîgwas” [birch]. The innermost bark of the White Birch is boiled to
extract a reddish dye by the Flambeau Ojibwe.</p>

<p><b>Hazelnut</b> (<i>Corylus americana</i> Walt.), “mûkwoˈbagaˈnak”. The
Flambeau Ojibwe make use of the seed hulls of the Hazelnut in setting
the black color of butternut dye. They are boiled together and the
tannic acid of the hull sets the color.</p>

<h4>FAGACEAE (BEECH FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Bur Oak</b> (<i>Quercus macrocarpa</i> Michx.), “mêtîˈgomîc”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use this bark in combination with other materials to set
color.</p>

<p><b>Black Oak</b> (<i>Quercus velutina</i> Lam.), “mêtîˈgomic”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use this bark for a reddish yellow dye and it sets its own color.</p>

<h4>JUGLANDACEAE (WALNUT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Butternut</b> (<i>Juglans cinerea</i> L.), “bagaˈnag”. The Flambeau and
Pillager Ojibwe find this one of their best brown dyes, because they
can get it from the tree at any time of the year. It is usually used in
other combinations for brown and black colors.</p>

<h4>MYRICACEAE (BAYBERRY FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Sweet Gale</b> (<i>Myrica gale</i> L.), “waˈsawasniˈmîke” [yellow catkins].
In the fall of the year, the tips of the branches grow into an abortive<span class="pagenum"><a name="p426" id="p426">[426]</a></span>
scale or gall-like structure that is plucked and boiled to yield a
brown dye stuff. The Flambeau Ojibwe seem to be the only Ojibwe
that know this.</p>

<h4>PAPAVERACEAE (POPPY FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Bloodroot</b> (<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i> L.), “meskwaˈdjibîkûk” [red
root]. The Ojibwe use this root in four or five combinations in dyeing
various materials. It is not necessary to mix it with other materials to
set the color and alone it gives a dark yellow or orange color. They
use it to paint the face, also, making different clan marks with it.
Either the fresh root or dried root may be used.</p>

<h4>PINACEAE (PINE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Hemlock</b> (<i>Tsuga canadensis</i> [L.] Carr.), “gagagiˈwîc”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use the bark together with a little rock dust to set the
color, to dye materials a dark red brown.</p>

<h4>RANUNCULACEAE (CROWFOOT FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Goldthread</b> (<i>Coptis trifolia</i> [L.] Salisb.), “weˈsawadjiˈbîkweˈak”
[yellow root?], shown in <a href="#plate75">plate 75</a>, fig. 1. The Flambeau Ojibwe add the
golden-colored roots to other plant dyes to emphasize the yellow color.</p>

<p><b>Bristly Crowfoot</b> (<i>Ranunculus pennsylvanicus</i> L. f.), “manweˈgons”.
The entire plant is boiled by the Flambeau Ojibwe to yield a
red coloring dye. Bur Oak is added to set the color.</p>

<h4>ROSACEAE (ROSE FAMILY)</h4>

<p><b>Wild Plum</b> (<i>Prunus nigra</i> Ait.), “bûgesanaˈtîg”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use the inner bark as an astringent color fixative in dyeing
with other plant dyes.</p>

<h2><a name="MISCELLANEOUS" id="MISCELLANEOUS"></a>MISCELLANEOUS USES OF PLANTS</h2>

<p>John Whitefeather, of the Couderay Ojibwe, in explaining the four
degrees of the medicine lodge, told the writer about the many uses of
charms or bewitching plants that the initiate learned in the fourth
degree. The Mîde who perfected himself in the fourth degree was called
a juggler or “Jessakîd”. He is supposed to have supernatural powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="p427" id="p427">[427]</a></span>
of magic, and can read the thoughts of others, as well as call forth the
ghosts or spirits of the other world. He can give Indians charms or
lures which will aid them to do almost anything they have in mind,
and he is most feared and respected among the Ojibwe.</p>

<p>These charms are supposed to work without physical contact and
are thus different from medicines. They are addressed and prayed over,
often with ceremonial tobacco offered to the four points of the compass,
to heaven and the earth. They are usually referred to as medicine, and
are carried in little buckskin packages about the person of the owner.
Much of the contents of the war bundle, hunting bundle or medicine
bundle, is composed of such charms. They guarantee a safe journey,
the winning of a lacrosse or bowl and dice game, and the ability to
find persons lost in the woods or lost articles. They can bewitch a
man’s wife, win the love of the opposite sex, work evil, and attract
game to be shot, or small animals to one’s traps. There is no doubt
that medicines were often applied with as much faith in their power
to charm as belief in the medicinal value of the medicine root for
that specific disease. The connection between actual and superstitious
remedies was oftentimes close.</p>

<p>Although a juggler or witch doctor had the power to cast these
spells or charms, he was also supposed to have the power to dispel
them and cure them. John Whitefeather called attention to the frequent
wry mouth or twisted side of an Indian’s face, and said that it had
been caused by some witch doctor, but that it could be corrected by
the victim, if he would pay the medicine man more to heal it than the
one had paid for bringing on the affliction in the first instance.
Many of their people think this unjust and the medicine man who does
it may have to leave the village and flee for his life. This actually
happened in the case of Anawabi and the boy who died of pneumonia,
the parents claiming that Anawabi took his breath away. Of course,
Anawabi was not within miles of the boy and assured the writer that
he had nothing at all to do with that case, nor had even thought about
it, but he made a hurried trip to Oklahoma and remained a couple of
years until the anger of the parents had lessened.</p>

<p>Some plants had been used in various tanning processes a very long
time ago by the Ojibwe, but none know anything about it now, so far
as the writer could discover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p428" id="p428">[428]</a></span></p>

<h3>APOCYNACEAE (DOGBANE FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Spreading Dogbane</b> (<i>Apocynum androsaemifolium</i> L.), “magoˈsiñeˈcnakwûk”
[needle like].<a name="FNanchor_147_63" id="FNanchor_147_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_63" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe say that this
is one of the roots the use of which is taught in the fourth degree of the
medicine lodge, and that it is not only eaten during the medicine lodge
ceremony, but is also chewed to keep the other witch doctors from
affecting one with an evil charm.</p>

<h3>ARACEAE (ARUM FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Sweet Flag</b> (<i>Acorus calamus</i> L.), “naˈbûgûck” [something flat].
The root tea of this is used by Big George, Flambeau Ojibwe, on his
gill net to bring him a fine catch of white fish. The net still
smelled of the Calamus root after being in the water more than twelve
hours, and he caught 121 white fish in one pull of the net in Flambeau
Lake. It is combined with the root of Sarsaparilla.</p>

<h3>ARALIACEAE (GINSENG FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Wild Sarsaparilla</b> (<i>Aralia nudicaulis</i> L.), “bebamabiˈk” [root
runs far through the ground]. This root is mixed with Sweet Flag
root to make a tea to soak a gill net before setting it to catch fish during
the night. Big George Skye, at Lac du Flambeau, was quite successful
in catching them.</p>

<h3>ASCLEPIADACEAE (MILKWEED FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Common Milkweed</b> (<i>Asclepias syriaca</i> L.), “înîniˈwûnj” [Indian
plant].<a name="FNanchor_148_64" id="FNanchor_148_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_64" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe use the milk of the Common Milkweed
along with the milk of Canada Hawkweed to put on a deer call, thinking
that it will better imitate the call of a fawn that is hungry or in distress.</p>

<h3>COMPOSITAE (COMPOSITE FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Blue Wood Aster</b> (<i>Aster cordifolius</i> L.), “naskosiˈîcûs”. A number
of the composites as well as plants from other families are used in the
Ojibwe hunting charms. The deer carries its scent or spoor in between
its toes, and wherever the foot is impressed into the ground,
other animals can detect its presence. It is thus dogs track them. It
is a peculiar scent and the Ojibwe tries successfully to counterfeit it
with roots and herbs. The root of this aster is but one of nineteen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p429" id="p429">[429]</a></span>
can be used to make a smoke or incense when smoked in a pipe,
which attracts the deer near enough to shoot it with a bow and arrow.
They say that the white man drives the deer away when he smokes
cigarettes or cigars, but the Indians bring them closer.</p>

<p><b>Large-leaved Aster</b> (<i>Aster macrophyllus</i> L.), “naskosiˈîcûs”. This
is one of the Flambeau Ojibwe hunting charms. It is smoked to attract
deer.</p>

<p><b>Horse-weed</b> (<i>Erigeron canadensis</i> L.), “wabîˈgwûn” [white flower].
This is one of the Flambeau Ojibwe hunting charms. The disk florets
are smoked.</p>

<p><b>Philadelphia Fleabane</b> (<i>Erigeron philadelphicus</i> L.), “mîcaoˈgacan”
[odor of split hoof of female deer]. The Pillager Ojibwe use
the disk florets of this plant to smoke to attract the buck deer. They
say that cows and deer eat the blossoms.</p>

<p><b>Canada Hawkweed</b> (<i>Hieracium canadense</i> Michx.) Under the
name “wabîˈgwûn” [white flower], some of the Flambeau Ojibwe use
the flowers to make a hunting lure, and mix it with their other hunting
charms. Others call it “mêmîskûˈnakûk” and say that they cut off the
roots and nibble at them when hunting. The roots are milky like the
stem and the hunter wanting a doe will pretend he is a fawn trying to
suckle and thus attract a doe close enough to shoot with bow and arrow.</p>

<p><b>Tall Blue Lettuce</b> (<i>Lactuca spicata</i> [Lam.] Hitchc.), “dodocaˈbo”
[milk]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use this plant in the same manner as they
do the Canada Hawkweed to attract a doe to them for a close shot.</p>

<p><b>Fragrant Golden-rod</b> (<i>Solidago graminifolia</i> [L.] Salisb.), “waˈsawaskwûneˈk”
[yellow light]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the flowers
of this golden-rod to add to their hunting medicine, which is smoked
to simulate the odor of a deer’s hoof.</p>

<p><b>Tansy</b> (<i>Tanacetum vulgare</i> L.), “mûckîkiˈwît” [medicine plant].
The yellow flowers are used by the Flambeau Ojibwe as an
addition to their odorous hunting mixture which they smoke to attract
deer.</p>

<h3>CORNACEAE (DOGWOOD FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Alternate-leaved Dogwood</b> (<i>Cornus alternifolia</i> L. f.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="p430" id="p430">[430]</a></span> “mosoˈmîc”
[moose tree]. The root is boiled by the Flambeau Ojibwe to
wash a muskrat trap and make it lure the muskrat.</p>

<h3>ERICACEAE (HEATH FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Shin Leaf</b> (<i>Pyrola americana</i> Sweet.), “bîneˈbûg” [partridge leaf].
The Flambeau Ojibwe hunter makes a tea from dried leaves of this
plant and drinks it as a good luck potion in the morning before he
starts to hunt.</p>

<h3>IRIDACEAE (IRIS FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Blue Flag</b> (<i>Iris versicolor</i> L.) “wikê”.<a name="FNanchor_149_65" id="FNanchor_149_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_65" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Both Flambeau and Pillager
Ojibwe use this as a charm against snakes and claim that Indians
all over the country use it the same way. When the Ojibwe go out
blueberrying all day, every one carries a piece of it in his clothes and
will handle it every little while to perpetuate the scent. They believe
that snakes will shun them while so protected. They say that the
Arizona Indians use it when they hold their snake dances and are never
struck as long as their clothes are fumigated with it. They also chew it
to get the odor into their mouths, preparatory to taking rattlesnakes
into their teeth. The rattlesnake never offers to bite them so long as
the scent of the Blue Flag persists.</p>

<h3>LABIATAE (MINT FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Heal-all</b> (<i>Prunella vulgaris</i> L.), “basiˈbûgûk”. The Flambeau
Ojibwe use the root of this plant to make a tea to drink before going
hunting. It is supposed to sharpen their powers of observation.</p>

<h3>LILIACEAE (LILY FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Northern Clintonia</b> (<i>Clintonia borealis</i> [Ait.] Raf.), “adotaˈgans”
[little bell].<a name="FNanchor_150_66" id="FNanchor_150_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_66" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The Pillager Ojibwe claim that dogs chew the roots
of this plant to poison their teeth, and if they then bite an animal it
will die. A man may protect himself from such a bite by using the
same root as a poultice on the wound.</p>

<p><b>Sessile-leaved Bellwort</b> (<i>Oakesia sessilifolia</i> [L.] Wats.), “neweîaˈkwisînk”
[one sided]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root of this plant
as a part of their mîcaoˈgacan hunting medicine to bring a buck deer
near the hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p431" id="p431">[431]</a></span></p>

<h3>ORCHIDACEAE (ORCHIS FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Rein Orchis</b> (<i>Habenaria bracteata</i> [Willd.] R. Br.), “gokoˈcgûnda
mîneskweˈmîn” [pig does, red root]. This plant is a sort of love charm
among the Pillager Ojibwe often put to bad use.</p>

<p><b>Slender Ladies’ Tresses</b> (<i>Spiranthes gracilis</i> [Bigel.] Beck), “bîneˈbûg”
[partridge leaf]. The Flambeau Ojibwe use the root as an ingredient
of their hunting charm to bring game to them.</p>

<h3>PLANTAGINACEAE (PLANTAIN FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Common Plantain</b> (<i>Plantago major</i> L.), “cecaˈgûski bûgeˈsînk”
[leaves grow up and also lie flat on the ground].<a name="FNanchor_151_67" id="FNanchor_151_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_67" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The highly colored
base and root of this plant appeal to the Flambeau Ojibwe who always
carry some of the ground root in their pockets to ward off snakes.</p>

<h3>POLYGONACEAE (BUCKWHEAT FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Swamp Persicaria</b> (<i>Polygonum muhlenbergii</i> [Meisn.] Wats.)
“agoñgosiˈmînûn”. The Flambeau Ojibwe dry the flower of this plant
and then include it in their hunting medicine, which is smoked to
attract deer to the hunter.</p>

<p><b>Curled Dock</b> (<i>Rumex crispus</i> L.), “ciobûg”. The dried seeds of
this dock are smoked when dried by the Flambeau Ojibwe, as a
favorable lure to game when mixed with kinnikinnik.</p>

<h3>PRIMULACEAE (PRIMROSE FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Starflower</b> (<i>Trientalis americana</i> [Pers.] Pursh.), “nawoˈbûgûk”
[four-leaved clover]. The root of this is mixed with many others to
make the smoking scent that attracts the deer to the hunter, according
to the Flambeau Ojibwe.</p>

<h3>RANUNCULACEAE (CROWFOOT FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Bristly Crowfoot</b> (<i>Ranunculus pennsylvanicus</i> L. f.), “manweˈ
gons”. The Flambeau Ojibwe smoke the seeds of this in their hunting
medicine to lure the buck deer near enough for a shot with bow and
arrow.</p>

<h3>ROSACEAE (ROSE FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Hawthorn</b> (<i>Crataegus</i> Sp.), “mînesagaˈwûnj”, shown in <a href="#plate77">plate 77</a>,
fig. 2. The bark of the Hawthorn was used by the Flambeau Ojibwe
in making up their deer scent for smoking to attract deer while hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p432" id="p432">[432]</a></span></p>

<h3>SCROPHULARIACEAE (FIGWORT FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Wood Betony</b> (<i>Pedicularis canadensis</i> L.), “mandaˈmînîodjiˈbîkêns”
[little corn root]. This is a sort of love charm according to
John Peper, Pillager Ojibwe, who said that the root was chopped up
and put into some dish of food that was cooking, without the knowledge
of the people who were going to eat it, and if they had been
quarrelsome, then they became lovers again. However, he said it
was too often put to bad uses.</p>

<h3>TYPHACEAE (CAT-TAIL FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Cat-tail</b> (<i>Typha latifolia</i> L.) “bebaˈmasûn” [it flies around]. The
Flambeau Ojibwe used to throw the fuzz of the fruit into the
eyes of their enemies, the Sioux, claiming that it blinded them.</p>

<h3>UMBELLIFERAE (PARSLEY FAMILY)</h3>

<p><b>Musquash Root</b> (<i>Cicuta maculata</i> L.), “abagwasîˈgans”. The
root of this is used in making a hunting medicine to be smoked to
attract the buck deer near enough to shoot with bow and arrow.</p>

<p><b>Cow Parsnip</b> (<i>Heracleum lanatum</i> Michx.) “pipigweˈwanûck”
[flute reed]. According to the Flambeau Ojibwe, there is a bad spirit
“sokênau”, who is always present trying to steal away one’s luck in
hunting game. He must be driven away from the camp of the hunter
by smudging a fire with the roots of the Cow Parsnip. This gets into
Sokênau’s eyes and he cannot see the hunter leave the camp, so naturally
does not follow and bother him. Other Flambeau Ojibwe call it
“acaweˈskûk” but use it in the same way. The Pillager Ojibwe have
the same name for the plant, but put the seed of the plant on a fire
to drive away Sokênau. They boil the root to sprinkle their fishing
nets and lure fish.</p>

<p><b>Water Parsnip</b> (<i>Sium cicutaefolium</i> Schrank.), “waneˈmîgons”.
The seed of this is smoked over a fire by the Flambeau Ojibwe to
drive away and blind Sokênau, the evil spirit that steals away one’s
hunting luck.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Pimpernel</b> (<i>Taenidia integerrima</i> [L.] Drude), “manweˈgons”
or “manweˈkos”. The Flambeau Ojibwe declare that the seeds
of this plant are very good for smoking in a pipe when one goes hunting
for they will bring him luck.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>The Ojibwe will always be interesting, because they prefer to live
in the backwoods, and because they cling so closely to their traditions.
A further reason is that they are more numerous than any other
Wisconsin tribe. They are good friends of the white people and find
it hard to keep to a strictly commercial basis, when hired as guides
for fishing and hunting. Many Milwaukee sportsmen have much appreciated
friends among the Ojibwe, who have ever been strict and
upright in their dealings with them.</p>

<p>There remains a considerable amount of folk lore or ethnology to
be studied and recorded, and since it is easy to find well educated men
and women among them, who still recall the traditions and stories
of their early life, it should prove a fertile field of investigation for
some student. The writer is satisfied that he has only touched the
surface in their ethnobotanical uses, knowing that three or four months
are really too short a time to get this lore from them. But he wishes
to close by saying that the Ojibwe are one of the most interesting
people he has ever met.</p>
